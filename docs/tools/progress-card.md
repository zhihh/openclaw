`progress_card` is the single agent status tool for a session. It stores an ordered step plan, a compact Markdown note, or both. Each call replaces the whole card, so the latest write is the source of truth for someone following the work without reading the transcript.

The card belongs to the parent session the user is talking to and its agent. Spawned sub-agents never receive `progress_card` or its prompt reminder, including visible dashboard children and resumed children. Their results return to the parent, which owns progress updates. The tool binds the session and agent from the running session; the model only supplies `markdown` and `plan`.

The card is durable session state. A reconnect or page reload reads the latest card from the Gateway instead of reconstructing it from tool events or transcript history. The transcript keeps only a short update receipt, not another full copy of the card.

## Adoption

OpenClaw adds a short progress-card reminder only for non-main, non-sub-agent sessions when a web, iOS, Android, or macOS card renderer is paired with the Gateway and the run is not using the agent's utility model. Channel-only deployments such as a WhatsApp-only Gateway do not receive the reminder.

The reminder says:

> During multi-step work, keep your progress card current with the progress_card tool; the user follows it instead of reading the transcript.

The reminder does not override tool policy. `tools.updatePlan: false` or a matching `tools.deny` entry still removes `progress_card` from the run entirely.

## Update a card

Both input fields are optional:

- `plan`: up to 50 ordered steps. Each step has non-empty `step` text and a `status` of `pending`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. At most one step may be `in_progress`.
- `markdown`: a compact narrative about what happened, what is blocked, or what comes next. Use it when a glanceable note says more than the step list; do not repeat the plan in Markdown.

For example:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    { "step": "Inspect the failing route", "status": "completed" },
    { "step": "Repair the session owner", "status": "in_progress" },
    { "step": "Run focused verification", "status": "pending" }
  ],
  "markdown": "The failure is isolated to session ownership. No blocker."
}
```

Every call is a replacement, not a patch. Omitting `markdown` removes the previous note; omitting `plan` removes the previous checklist.

The tool returns a short receipt such as `Progress card updated (rev 4, 1/3 done)` or `Progress card updated (rev 4)` when there is no plan. Its structured result contains the revision and completed/total step counts, or `null` without a plan. Successful writes also update channel previews from the complete plan state. Failed or blocked writes leave the previous plan in place. Active channel previews retain a safe failure notice.

## Format the note

Choose the representation that makes the current state easiest to scan: use a table for comparisons or metrics, a progress bar for one long operation, and a checklist only when the work is genuinely sequential. Omit the checklist when a table, bar, or sentence says it better, and do not repeat the same facts across the plan and Markdown. Markdown accepts ordinary formatting, links, and optional progress bars:

```md
<progress aria-label="Tests · 3/7" value="3" max="7"></progress>

Tests are running.

| check      | state   |
| ---------- | ------- |
| unit tests | passed  |
| live flow  | running |
```

Put one progress bar first and give it a short `aria-label` with its purpose and current/total values. In the session hovercard, the Agent Notepad pins the bar above the note and shows that label. Other raw HTML is stripped by the Markdown sanitizer.

## Limits

- Markdown: at most 8,192 UTF-8 bytes.
- Plan: at most 50 steps.
- Step text: non-empty and at most 512 UTF-8 bytes per step.
- Active work: at most one `in_progress` step.

The Gateway removes invisible Unicode and bidirectional control characters from Markdown and step text before storing the card.

## Clear a card

Call `progress_card` with both parts absent or empty to remove the current card:

```json
{}
```

An empty plan plus empty or whitespace-only Markdown also clears it. A successful clear returns `Progress card cleared`. Channel previews remove the checklist and its status, keep other activity, and delete an otherwise empty draft. A later card update can create a new draft.

## Where the card appears

Channels with progress drafts show the latest checklist in active `partial`, `block`, and `progress` previews, subject to their preview settings and line limits. Card updates supply a completion count, or `Progress updated` for a note without steps; they do not copy the note's Markdown or HTML into tool summaries. Telegram uses native checkboxes with `channels.telegram.richMessages: true` and readable HTML checklists otherwise. See [Streaming and chunking](/concepts/streaming#progress-draft-rendering).

The current chat keeps exactly one live card in the main conversation:

- The card appears in the collapsible surface inside the composer at every width.

Opening a side panel does not move the card out of the conversation. The placements are mutually exclusive. Hover a session row in the sidebar or a session-reference link in chat to see the same card for that session. All card placements read the same Gateway-backed state and refresh after `progressCard.changed` notifications. A notification is a refresh hint, including a null revision; clients confirm a removal with a read or clear response for that session and agent.

Transient refresh failures retain the last loaded card. The dashboard widget shows a retry notice until a refresh succeeds. If the Gateway reports that the connection no longer participates in the session, clients hide the card until access is restored and a refresh succeeds.

The composer and dashboard placements show the local time of the last progress update. The hovercard instead shows the current-or-next plan step and its completed/total count, followed by Markdown in a separate Agent Notepad when a note is present.

Without a matching terminal outcome, unfinished steps appear paused when the Gateway reports no active run or the card predates a later run. The last-update time shows when the agent last revised the card; elapsed time alone does not expire a card belonging to an active run.

## Gateway requests

`progressCard.get` and `progressCard.put` accept a required `sessionKey` and optional `agentId`. Pass both when selecting an agent explicitly, for example `{ "sessionKey": "global", "agentId": "research" }`. Omitting `agentId` retains the Gateway's existing session-owner resolution. An unknown agent or an agent that conflicts with the session owner is rejected.

Keep the original session and agent together for subsequent reads and clears. The returned card and change event use an agent-qualified display key; that key alone cannot distinguish a retained `global` session from an ordinary session whose key is `agent:<agentId>:global`. Both methods use the selected session’s normal access checks, in addition to their operator read or write scope.

The Control UI ships with its Gateway and follows the captured session owner without version negotiation: ordinary agent-qualified keys omit redundant `agentId`, while raw targets retain their explicit owner. Gateways also advertise `progress-card-agent-scope-v1` in `hello.features.capabilities` for independently upgraded clients, such as native apps. Those clients check the capability before sending `agentId`: ordinary agent-qualified keys can omit the field, while a canonical `global` target with an explicit owner requires it. If that capability is missing, the independently upgraded client reports that a Gateway update is needed.

## Pin the card to the dashboard

Use the `dashboard` tool to keep the live card on the current session's dashboard:

```json
{
  "action": "widget_put",
  "name": "session-progress",
  "title": "Session progress",
  "pluginKind": "session:progress",
  "size": "md"
}
```

Omit `props.sessionKey` to follow the dashboard's session. To show another session's card, add `"props": { "sessionKey": "agent:main:release" }`. The current connection must participate in that session; otherwise select an accessible session or change its sharing.

summary: "Bun workflow for installs, package scripts, and opt-in runtime use"
read_when:
  - You want to install dependencies or run package scripts with Bun
  - You want to run OpenClaw with Bun 1.4+
  - You hit Bun install/patch/lifecycle script issues
title: "Bun"
---

<Warning>
Node remains OpenClaw's primary, default, and recommended runtime. Bun 1.4+ builds that provide WAL-reset-safe `node:sqlite` can run the CLI, Gateway, and managed node host as an explicit opt-in. OpenClaw requires SQLite 3.51.3+, 3.50.7+ within 3.50.x, or 3.44.6+ within 3.44.x; older Bun versions and builds with unsafe SQLite are rejected.
</Warning>

Bun remains usable as an optional package-script runner. The default package manager remains `pnpm`, which is fully supported and used by docs tooling. Bun cannot use `pnpm-lock.yaml` and ignores it, and current Bun versions fail to resolve this repo's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` layout during `bun install`, so dependency installs should use `pnpm install`.

## Install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

    Bun cannot resolve this repo's pnpm workspace layout, so `bun install` fails during workspace resolution. Use `pnpm install`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Build and test">
    ```sh
    bun run build
    bun run vitest run
    ```

    Use Node by default for commands that launch OpenClaw.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run OpenClaw with Bun">
    To run onboarding under Bun and install the managed Gateway under Bun:

    ```sh
    bun openclaw.mjs onboard --install-daemon --daemon-runtime bun
    ```

    For a managed node host, select Bun separately:

    ```sh
    bun openclaw.mjs node install --runtime bun
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Lifecycle scripts

Bun blocks dependency lifecycle scripts unless explicitly trusted. For this repo, the commonly blocked scripts are not required:

- `baileys` `preinstall`: checks Node major >= 20 (OpenClaw requires Node 22.22.3+, 24.15+, or 25.9+, with Node 26 recommended)
- `protobufjs` `postinstall`: emits warnings about incompatible version schemes (no build artifacts)

If you hit a runtime issue that needs these scripts, trust them explicitly:

```sh
bun pm trust baileys protobufjs
```

## Caveats

On macOS, Bun uses Apple's system SQLite, which omits native extension loading.
OpenClaw can open ordinary agent databases without extension loading when that
library meets the WAL safety floor. Operations that require extensions, including `sqlite-vec`, need an
extension-capable SQLite library. Use Node, or preload a compatible SQLite
library with Bun's [custom SQLite setup](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/sqlite#loadextension)
before opening any database. OpenClaw does not select a different SQLite library
automatically.

Some package scripts hardcode `pnpm` internally (for example `check:docs`, `ui:*`, `protocol:check`). Running them via `bun run` still shells out to `pnpm`, so just run those via `pnpm` directly.

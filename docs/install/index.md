## System requirements

- **Node 22.22.3+, 24.15+, or 25.9+** - Node 26 is recommended; the installer provisions Node 26 on macOS and Node 24 LTS on Linux when Node is missing.
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** - Windows users can start with the native Windows Hub app, the PowerShell CLI installer, or a WSL2 Gateway. See [Windows](/platforms/windows).
- `pnpm` is only needed if you build from source.

## Download the desktop app

Prefer a normal app download over the CLI? OpenClaw ships desktop companions:

- **Windows**: the [Windows Hub](/platforms/windows#recommended-windows-hub) companion app — a signed installer you download and run like any Windows app, with setup, tray status, chat, and node mode:
  - [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-node/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe)
  - [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-node/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe)
  - All Hub releases: [Windows Hub releases page](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-node/releases/latest)
- **macOS**: the [macOS menu bar app](/platforms/macos) — download the `OpenClaw-<version>.dmg` (preferred) or `.zip` asset from [OpenClaw GitHub releases](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases), then install and launch **OpenClaw.app**. See the [macOS app page](/platforms/macos) for details, including what to do when the newest release ships no macOS asset.

Both desktop apps can provision a local Gateway during first-run setup, or connect to an existing remote Gateway.

## Recommended: installer script

The fastest way to install. It detects your OS, installs Node if needed, installs OpenClaw, and launches onboarding.

<Note>
Windows desktop users can also install the native [Windows Hub](/platforms/windows#recommended-windows-hub) companion app, which includes setup, tray status, chat, node mode, and local MCP mode.

## Alternative install methods

### Local prefix installer (`install-cli.sh`)

Use this when you want OpenClaw and Node kept under a local prefix such as
`~/.openclaw`, without depending on a system-wide Node install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install-cli.sh | bash
```

It supports npm installs by default, plus git-checkout installs under the same
prefix flow. Full reference: [Installer internals](/install/installer#install-clish).

Already installed? Switch between package and git installs with
`openclaw update --channel dev` and `openclaw update --channel stable`. See
[Updating](/install/updating#switch-between-npm-and-git-installs).

### npm, pnpm, or bun

If you already manage Node yourself:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    On npm 12 or npm 11.16+:

    ```bash
    npm install -g openclaw@latest --allow-scripts=openclaw
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```

    On npm 11.15 and earlier, use the same command without
    `--allow-scripts=openclaw`.

    <Note>
    npm 12 blocks unapproved package lifecycle scripts by default. The
    `--allow-scripts=openclaw` option explicitly allows OpenClaw's `preinstall`
    and `postinstall` steps; without it, npm reports them as `blocked because
    they are not covered by allowScripts`.

    npm 11.16 accepts the option but otherwise only warns that the scripts are
    `not yet covered by allowScripts` and still runs them. npm 11.15 and earlier
    have neither the policy nor the option, so their command must be unflagged.
    The `npm approve-scripts openclaw`
    command suggested by npm 11.16 does not work for a global install — it fails
    with `ENOMATCH  No installed packages match: openclaw`.
    </Note>

    <Note>
    The hosted installer clears npm freshness filters such as `min-release-age`
    for the OpenClaw package install. If you install manually with npm, your own
    npm policy still applies.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g --allow-build=openclaw openclaw@latest
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```

    <Note>
    pnpm requires explicit approval for packages with build scripts. `approve-builds -g` is not supported for global installs, so pass `--allow-build=openclaw` on the `pnpm add -g` command instead.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add -g --trust openclaw@latest
    bun run --bun openclaw onboard --install-daemon --daemon-runtime bun
    ```

    <Note>
    `--trust` allows OpenClaw's package lifecycle scripts for this install. Bun
    1.4 or newer can also run OpenClaw's CLI, local agent, and Gateway. Node
    remains the primary runtime, so the plain `openclaw` executable keeps its
    Node shebang. `bun run --bun` forces the Bun runtime, while
    `--daemon-runtime bun` installs the managed Gateway under Bun.
    </Note>

### From source

For contributors or anyone who wants to run from a local checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
corepack enable
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm ui:build
pnpm add --global "openclaw@link:$PWD"
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

`pnpm add --global "openclaw@link:$PWD"` links the CLI to this checkout without changing its package files. If pnpm reports that its global bin directory is not on `PATH`, run `pnpm setup`, reopen your shell, and retry.

Corepack selects the exact pnpm version from `package.json` (currently pnpm 12).
If Corepack is unavailable, install that version explicitly with
`npm install -g pnpm@12.3.4 --allow-scripts=pnpm@12.3.4`; keep npm install scripts and optional dependencies
enabled so pnpm can provision its native executable.

Or skip the global install and use `pnpm openclaw ...` from inside the repo. See [Setup](/start/setup) for full development workflows.

### Install from the GitHub main checkout

```bash
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git --version main
```

## Verify the install

```bash
openclaw --version      # confirm the CLI is available
openclaw doctor         # check for config issues
openclaw gateway status # verify the Gateway is running
```

If you want managed startup after install:

- macOS: LaunchAgent via `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` or `openclaw gateway install`
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service via the same commands
- Native Windows: Scheduled Task first, with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied

## Troubleshooting: `openclaw` not found

Almost always a PATH issue: npm's global bin directory isn't on your shell's `PATH`. See [Node.js troubleshooting](/install/node#troubleshooting) for the full fix, including the Windows path.

```bash
node -v           # Node installed?
npm prefix -g     # Where are global packages?
echo "$PATH"      # Is the global bin dir in PATH?
```

read_when:
  - You used api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory before OpenClaw 2026.4.25
  - You are updating a plugin to the modern plugin architecture
  - You maintain an external OpenClaw plugin
---

OpenClaw replaced a broad backwards-compatibility layer with a modern plugin
architecture built from small, focused imports. If your plugin predates that
change, this guide gets it onto the current contracts.

## What changed

Several wide-open import surfaces used to let plugins reach almost anything
from a single entry point:

- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk`** and **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat`** - re-exported
  dozens of helpers while the focused SDK was being built. Both roots are now
  removed; import a documented subpath instead.
- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime`** - a broad barrel mixing system
  events, heartbeat state, delivery queues, fetch/proxy helpers, file helpers,
  approval types, and unrelated utilities.
- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-runtime`** - a broad config barrel retained
  for compatibility, including deprecated direct `loadConfig` and
  `writeConfigFile` exports. Those methods were removed from the injected
  plugin runtime, not from this retained facade.
- **`openclaw/extension-api`** - a removed bridge that gave plugins direct
  access to host-side helpers like the embedded agent runner.
- **`api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)`** - a removed embedded-runner-only
  hook that observed embedded-runner events such as `tool_result`. Use agent
  tool-result middleware instead (see [Migrate embedded tool-result extensions
  to middleware](#how-to-migrate)).

The root SDK, compat barrel, extension bridge, and embedded extension factory
have been removed. `infra-runtime` and `config-runtime` remain only for their
separately recorded later windows; new plugins should use focused subpaths.

<Warning>
  Plugins importing the removed root, compat, or extension surfaces no longer
  load. Follow the mappings below before upgrading.
</Warning>

OpenClaw does not remove or reinterpret documented plugin behavior in the same
change that introduces a replacement. Breaking contract changes go through a
compatibility adapter, diagnostics, docs, and a deprecation window first. That
applies to SDK imports, manifest fields, setup APIs, hooks, and runtime
registration behavior.

`ChatCommandDefinition.category` retains the `"docks"` value accepted by the
2026.8.1 SDK. Command lists display these legacy definitions under **Tools**;
the category does not enable channel docking or restore retired docking commands.
New definitions should use `"tools"`.

### Why

- **Slow startup** - importing one helper loaded dozens of unrelated modules.
- **Circular dependencies** - broad re-exports made import cycles easy to
  create.
- **Unclear API surface** - no way to tell stable exports from internal ones.

The typed public SDK is organized into focused subpaths with documented
contracts. Not every SDK build entrypoint is a public plugin API.

Legacy provider convenience seams for bundled channels are gone too -
channel-branded helper shortcuts were private mono-repo conveniences, not
stable plugin contracts. Use narrow generic SDK subpaths instead. Inside the
bundled plugin workspace, keep provider-owned helpers in that plugin's own
`api.ts` or `runtime-api.ts`:

- Anthropic keeps Claude-specific stream helpers in its own `api.ts` /
  `contract-api.ts` seam.
- OpenAI keeps provider builders, default-model helpers, and realtime provider
  builders in its own `api.ts`.
- OpenRouter keeps provider builder and onboarding/config helpers in its own
  `api.ts`.

## Compatibility policy

External-plugin compatibility work follows this order:

1. Add the new contract.
2. Keep the old behavior wired through a compatibility adapter.
3. Emit a diagnostic or warning naming the old path and replacement.
4. Cover both paths in tests.
5. Document the deprecation and migration path.
6. Remove only after the announced migration window, usually in a major
   release.

### Retained helper contracts

Retained compatibility entrypoints keep their shipped caller names:
`inbound-envelope` uses `resolveStorePath`, `provider-catalog-runtime` exports
`resolvePluginProviders`, and `agent-runtime`'s
`resolveThinkingDefaultWithRuntimeCatalog` accepts `loadModelCatalog`.

`text-chunking` retains positional `CodeRegion` inputs with `start` and `end`
offsets for `isInsideCode`. Regions returned by `findCodeRegions` additionally
include parser-owned `block` metadata; callers supplying their own ranges do not
need to provide it.

### Harness attempt result migration

In OpenClaw 2026.8.1, `EmbeddedRunAttemptResult` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime` requires the canonical `terminal`
field. Source written against the 2026.7 direct alias must migrate when it
constructs results with legacy fields such as `aborted`, `timedOut`, and
`promptError`; retaining the alias name does not make those old constructors
source-compatible.

Use `AgentHarnessAttemptResult` from the same subpath while migrating a
legacy result producer. That union accepts both the legacy fields and the
canonical result, and the host lifecycle normalizes legacy results before
core consumes them. New producers should construct `terminal`; consumers of
the union must narrow the result before reading it. The current
`EmbeddedRunAttemptResult` contract keeps `terminal` required.

### Model-provider result compatibility

`openclaw/plugin-sdk/models-provider-runtime` preserves the `ModelsProviderData`
construction shape and `buildModelsProviderData` return signature published in
`v2026.7.1-2`, including typed adapters that return that shape. These contracts
remain supported until an explicitly approved SDK-breaking boundary.

Call `buildPreparedModelsProviderData` when forwarding model selections. Its
result includes the required `modelCatalog` with
the selected physical-route metadata. Both builders use one metadata producer;
callers must carry prepared rows forward rather than reconstructing them from IDs.

### Memory read missing results

Memory managers now return `status: "ok"` for successful excerpts and
`status: "not_found"` when an allowed file is missing. This keeps empty files
and empty ranges distinct from missing files without relying on pagination
metadata.

At registration, every statusless result from an older external memory manager
preserves its legacy successful-read semantics and becomes `status: "ok"`,
including empty results without range metadata. Only an explicit
`status: "not_found"` reports absence. New producers must emit that status for
missing files; registered-input normalization remains available through the
next Plugin SDK major.

### Plugin state migration declarations

Bundled plugins should list every migration under
`doctorContract.stateMigrations` in `openclaw.plugin.json` and export the
matching `stateMigrations` array from their doctor-contract artifact. Keep the
IDs, order, `doctorOnly` flags, and phases identical. Read-only Doctor planning
uses candidate-bundled descriptors to record exact plugin owners without
loading the plugin.

Installed external plugin artifacts are not part of the copied-state or
candidate content identity. Copied-state planning refuses their migrations,
including manifests that contain descriptor arrays, until candidate validation
binds those artifacts separately. The legacy value `true` continues to locate
their dynamic contract for non-planning Doctor flows.

Plan-based migrations can use
`definePluginDoctorMigrationFromPlans(...)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-doctor-migrations` to preserve existing move, copy, preview,
and plugin-state import behavior.

For single-file imports, `defineLegacyJsonStateMigration(...)` skips missing
sources (`ENOENT`) and values the plugin parser rejects with `null`. Other read
errors and invalid JSON reach Doctor's detection or migration warnings; the
source remains untouched so the operator can fix it and retry.

Use `phase: "after-session-repair"` when a migration needs canonical session
ownership evidence. Ordinary Doctor detects these migrations; `--fix` applies
them after session repair under SQLite maintenance ownership. The context
provides bounded `readPluginStateEntriesInKeyRange` and
`readSessionIdentityEvidenceBatch` reads, plus
`deletePluginStateEntriesIfUnchanged` only during a fenced repair. Preserve
unknown or ambiguous ownership. Delete only the observed raw rows; callbacks
retained after maintenance ends cannot authorize later writes.

The setup-entry `legacyStateMigrations` option and feature flag,
`setupFeatures.legacyStateMigrations`,
`BundledChannelLegacyStateMigrationDetector`, and
`ChannelPlugin.lifecycle.detectLegacyStateMigrations` remain supported through
one doctor-pipeline adapter for external plugins, but are deprecated. Removal
plan: remove that adapter after OpenClaw 2027.1 only when a published-plugin
reader sweep finds no remaining users.

### AuthStorage SQLite migration

`AuthStorage.forAgent(agentDir)` is the canonical constructor for host session
storage. It persists provider-default credentials through the agent's
`openclaw-agent.sqlite` auth-profile rows and never creates `auth.json`.
Harness plugins receive the prepared storage instance as `params.authStorage`.

`AuthStorage.create(authPath)` remains as a named deprecated adapter for
existing plugins. The path is used only to derive the owning agent directory;
the adapter reads and writes SQLite, not the named JSON file. Migrate to
`forAgent(...)` now. The path-taking form emits
`AUTH_STORAGE_CREATE_DEPRECATED` and is eligible for removal after
2026-10-01, provided the published-plugin reader sweep is clean.

`FileAuthStorageBackend` is an internal SQLite-backed adapter, not an exported
Plugin SDK backend. It is not available as a named import from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-sessions`. Harness plugins should use the
host-prepared `params.authStorage`; host code that constructs storage should
use `AuthStorage.forAgent(agentDir)`. The internal adapter emits
`FILE_AUTH_STORAGE_BACKEND_DEPRECATED` and never reads or writes the legacy
file. Its internal deprecation window does not preserve the former SDK import.

If a manifest field is still accepted, keep using it until docs and
diagnostics say otherwise. New code should prefer the documented replacement;
existing plugins should not break during ordinary minor releases.

The dated compatibility registry also tracks shipped annotations that do not
belong to one legacy subpath. These records use 2026-10-01 as the earliest
review date; removal still requires the reader condition in the final column.

| Compatibility code                        | Replacement                                                                                    | Removal condition                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin-sdk-broad-runtime-barrels`        | Focused capability subpaths                                                                    | No bundled or published imports of the seven enumerated broad barrels remain.                |
| `plugin-sdk-provider-owned-helper-shims`  | Provider-local auth/model/replay/OAuth/stream APIs                                             | Every enumerated helper is migrated in official providers and absent from published plugins. |
| `message-presentation-legacy-bridges`     | `MessagePresentation` and channel presentation renderers                                       | Producers and official channel packages no longer emit or read legacy interactive replies.   |
| `plugin-sdk-focused-compat-aliases`       | The focused replacement named by each `@deprecated` annotation                                 | Every enumerated alias has zero bundled and published readers.                               |
| `agent-harness-terminal-result-aliases`   | `AgentHarnessAttemptResult.terminal` and `visibleReplies`                                      | Harness plugins no longer read legacy terminal booleans or `sourceVisibleReplies`.           |
| `official-plugin-export-aliases`          | Canonical Google Meet testing, presentation renderers, and host-owned Discord timeout behavior | Minimum supported official plugin packages no longer import the aliases.                     |

| `plugin-runtime-api-compat-aliases`       | Namespaced plugin APIs and focused runtime methods                                             | All enumerated flat API/runtime aliases have no readers.                                     |
| `plugin-provider-manifest-compat-aliases` | Manifest-owned kind/setup metadata and model catalog registration                              | Providers no longer publish runtime kind or legacy catalog hooks.                            |

### Published channel setup compatibility

Slack, Discord, Signal, and Microsoft Teams packages published through
`2026.7.1` import channel-specific config schemas from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/bundled-channel-config-schema`. The published Slack and
Discord packages also import `createLegacyCompatChannelDmPolicy` and
`promptLegacyChannelAllowFromForAccount` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/setup-runtime`.

Those exports remain available as deprecated runtime compatibility adapters.
New and republished plugins should own their config schemas and setup policy
locally, using generic primitives from `channel-config-schema` and
`setup-runtime`. The compatibility exports can be removed only after the
minimum supported published package versions no longer import them.

### Channel setup input field compatibility

`ChannelSetupInput` now keeps only the cross-channel setup envelope typed
permanently. Channel-specific fields remain typed in a deprecated compatibility
tier so existing external plugins still compile while plugin authors move those
fields into plugin-local setup input types.

OpenClaw does not ship major releases. A registry sweep on 2026-07-22 inspected
426 published out-of-tree channel plugins and removed 21 fields with no readers.
The 22 retained fields each have a known published reader. Each further field is
deleted as soon as no published plugin reads it; the retained set shrinks as
plugin authors migrate to plugin-local setup input types.

The same sweep removed 23 legacy undeclared-adapter promotion keys with no
published dependents. Six common keys and the setup-only `rooms` key remain.
That set also shrinks as published plugins declare `singleAccountKeysToMove`.

The shared type has no index signature. Plugin-owned keys can still be present
on runtime input objects; declare them in a plugin-local intersection or narrow
them through the owning plugin's setup schema.

| `code`                                  | `owner`   | `replacement`                                                                                    | Removal condition                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin-sdk-channel-setup-input-fields` | `channel` | Intersect `ChannelSetupInput` with a plugin-local type that declares the owning channel's fields | Delete a field when the published-plugin registry sweep has no reader |

The legacy undeclared-adapter promotion tier follows the same reader-driven
policy. Declare `singleAccountKeysToMove`, including an empty array when the
plugin needs no extra promotion keys, so the shared fallback can be retired one
key at a time.

#### Verifying readers

1. Page through `https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/packages?family=code-plugin&limit=100` with each `nextCursor`, and keep packages whose `categories` include `channels`.
2. Add npm candidates from `npm search --json --searchlimit=1000 "openclaw channel plugin"`. Add source-only candidates from GitHub code searches for `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-setup`, `openclaw/plugin-sdk/setup`, and `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core`.
3. Resolve each candidate's latest published version. Run `npm pack <package>@<version> --json --pack-destination <temp-dir>`, unpack it, and inspect shipped `dist` JavaScript and declarations for direct or destructured field reads. Download the ClawHub artifact when a package has no npm release.
4. Record package, version, field or promotion key, and matching file. A field or key is deletable only when no published plugin artifact reads it. Keep the reader names in the code comments beside the retained field and key lists synchronized with the sweep.

This is a source/type compatibility record only. The registry entry has
`removeAfter: 2026-10-01`, but setup input runtime objects and behavior are
unchanged. The date starts a review; each field remains until its published
artifact reader count is zero.

Audit the current migration queue with `pnpm plugins:boundary-report`:

| Flag                                                    | Effect                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--json`                                                | Machine-readable report.                                                                           |
| `--owner <id>`                                          | Filter to one compatibility owner.                                                                 |
| `--fail-on-eligible-compat`                             | Exit non-zero for dated `deprecated` records starting at 00:00 UTC on the day after `removeAfter`. |

`pnpm plugins:boundary-report:ci` runs with the compatibility fail flag.
For dated `deprecated` records, `removeAfter` is the final compatibility day:
`2026-09-01` becomes eligible at `2026-09-02T00:00:00Z`, not at the start of
September 1. `removal-pending` records are separate: they become due for review
at 00:00 UTC on their `removeAfter` date and are reported with blockers, but do
not trigger this fail flag. Neither state authorizes automatic removal.

Deprecated records normally have an explicit `removeAfter` date. A contract
tied to a version boundary instead declares a `removalGate`;
`next-plugin-sdk-major` is an approved major-version gate, not a pending owner
decision, and is never date-eligible. A record with neither field appears as
`no-date` and remains ineligible until its owner publishes a gate. The report
displays either the date or named gate, counts local code/doc references, lists
`removal-pending` records with their blockers and surface-token reader
references, and summarizes the private memory-host SDK bridge. Those reader
references are triage signals, not published-artifact proof.

### Media legacy projection

The `media-legacy-projection` compatibility record covers the old parallel
media fields, payload builders, hook metadata aliases, and media template
names. Its approved `removeAfter` date is **2026-10-01** (two release trains
after the facts-first replacements shipped). Removal additionally requires a
clean published-plugin artifact sweep at that time; migrate before the date.

For channel ingress, replace singular/plural `MediaPath`, `MediaUrl`,
`MediaType`, `MediaPaths`, `MediaUrls`, `MediaTypes`,
`MediaTranscribedIndexes`, `MediaWorkspaceDir`, and `MediaStaged` with ordered
facts:

```ts
import { toInboundMediaFacts } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound";

const media = toInboundMediaFacts([
  { path: saved.path, url: nativeUrl, contentType: saved.contentType, messageId },
]);

const ctx = finalizeInboundContext({ Body: caption, media });
```

Use `event.media` in `inbound_claim` and `message_received` hooks. If remote
media is not locally staged, use `event.originalMedia` for identity/diagnostics
and wait for `event.media`; `event.mediaStagingPending` distinguishes that
state. Do not read the deprecated singular/plural properties from
`event.metadata`.

For CLI media models, replace `{{MediaPath}}`, `{{MediaUrl}}`, `{{MediaType}}`,
and `{{MediaDir}}` with `{{AttachmentPath}}`, `{{AttachmentUrl}}`,
`{{AttachmentContentType}}`, and `{{AttachmentDir}}`. Use
`{{AttachmentIndex}}` when attachment position matters.

For local media read policy, import `getAgentScopedMediaLocalRoots(...)` or
`getAgentScopedMediaLocalRootsForSources(...)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/media-local-roots`. The
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-media-payload` facade and its
`buildAgentMediaPayload(...)` projection are deprecated.

## How to migrate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Migrate runtime config load/write helpers">
    Bundled plugins should stop calling `api.runtime.config.loadConfig()` and
    `api.runtime.config.writeConfigFile(...)` directly. Prefer config already
    passed into the active call path. Long-lived handlers that need the
    current process snapshot can use `api.runtime.config.current()`. Long-lived
    agent tools should read `ctx.getRuntimeConfig()` inside `execute` so a tool
    created before a config write still sees the refreshed config.

    Config writes go through the transactional helper with an explicit
    after-write policy:

    ```typescript
    await api.runtime.config.mutateConfigFile({
      afterWrite: { mode: "auto" },
      mutate(draft) {
        draft.plugins ??= {};
      },
    });
    ```

    Use `afterWrite: { mode: "restart", reason: "..." }` when the change needs
    a clean gateway restart, and `afterWrite: { mode: "none", reason: "..." }`
    only when the caller owns the follow-up and deliberately suppresses the
    reload planner. Mutation results include a typed `followUp` summary for
    tests and logging; the gateway remains responsible for applying or
    scheduling the restart.

    `loadConfig` and `writeConfigFile` have been removed from the plugin
    runtime. Bundled plugins and repo runtime code are guarded by
    `pnpm check:deprecated-api-usage` and
    `pnpm check:no-runtime-action-load-config`: new production plugin usage
    fails outright, direct config writes fail, gateway server methods must use
    the request runtime snapshot, runtime channel send/action/client helpers
    must receive config from their boundary, and long-lived runtime modules
    allow zero ambient `loadConfig()` calls.

    New plugin code should avoid the broad `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-runtime`
    barrel. Use the narrow subpath for the job:

    | Need | Import |
    | --- | --- |
    | Config types such as `OpenClawConfig` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-contracts` |
    | Plugin-entry config lookup | `api.pluginConfig` |
    | Config merging | Plugin-local logic at the config boundary |
    | Current runtime snapshot reads | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-config-snapshot` |
    | Config writes | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-mutation` |
    | Session store helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-store-runtime` |
    | Markdown table config | `api.runtime.channel.text.resolveMarkdownTableMode` |
    | Channel group policy, mention requirements, and sender tool policy | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-policy` |
    | Provider-default group-policy fallback helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-group-policy` |
    | Secret input resolution | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/secret-input-runtime` |
    | Model/session overrides | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/model-session-runtime` |

    `api.pluginConfig` is registration-scoped, not a live getter. Replacing
    `resolveLivePluginConfigObject(...)` requires preserving freshness through
    the current config supplied by the runtime boundary. The injected markdown
    resolver preserves channel/account precedence and channel defaults;
    `markdown-table-runtime` is a private, JavaScript-only host export.

    Check named types separately. `config-contracts` does not export `TtsMode`,
    `TtsPersonaConfig`, `TtsPersonaFallbackPolicy`, or `SessionResetMode`;
    `session-store-runtime` does not export `SessionResetMode` either. Existing
    callers needing those names must keep retained type imports or explicitly
    adapt their types. Talk config, cron-store operations, context-visibility
    config resolution, and dangerous-name checks also lack a complete modern
    typed-public mapping. Missing public contracts require an SDK-owner decision,
    not an import of the private focused implementation.

    Bundled plugins and their tests are scanner-guarded against the broad
    barrel so imports and mocks stay local to the behavior they need. The
    barrel still exists for external compatibility, but new code should not
    depend on it.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate embedded tool-result extensions to middleware">
    Bundled plugins must replace embedded-runner-only
    `api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)` tool-result handlers with
    runtime-neutral middleware:

    ```typescript
    // OpenClaw runtime tools and Codex runtime dynamic tools (result may be
    // transformed). Codex-native tool results are also relayed for observation,
    // but their transformed output never reaches the model: the Codex
    // PostToolUse hook contract cannot replace a native tool response.
    api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(async (event) => {
      return compactToolResult(event);
    }, {
      runtimes: ["openclaw", "codex"],
    });
    ```

    Update the plugin manifest at the same time:

    ```json
    {
      "contracts": {
        "agentToolResultMiddleware": ["openclaw", "codex"]
      }
    }
    ```

    Installed plugins can also register tool-result middleware when explicitly
    enabled and every targeted runtime is declared in
    `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware`. Undeclared installed middleware
    registrations are rejected.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate approval-native handlers to capability facts">
    Approval-capable channel plugins expose native approval behavior through
    `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime` plus the shared runtime-context
    registry:

    - Replace `approvalCapability.handler.loadRuntime(...)` with
      `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime`.
    - Move approval-specific auth/delivery off legacy `plugin.auth` /
      `plugin.approvals` wiring and onto `approvalCapability`.
    - `ChannelPlugin.approvals` has been removed from the public
      channel-plugin contract; move delivery/native/render fields onto
      `approvalCapability`.
    - `plugin.auth` remains for channel login/logout flows only; core no
      longer reads approval auth hooks there.
    - Register channel-owned runtime objects (clients, tokens, Bolt apps)
      through `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime-context`.
    - Do not send plugin-owned reroute notices from native approval handlers;
      core owns routed-elsewhere notices from actual delivery results.
    - When passing `channelRuntime` into `createChannelManager(...)`, provide a
      real `createPluginRuntime().channel` surface - partial stubs are
      rejected.

    See [Channel Plugins](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins) for the current
    approval capability layout.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Windows wrapper fallback behavior">
    If your plugin uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk/windows-spawn`, unresolved Windows
    `.cmd`/`.bat` wrappers now fail closed unless you explicitly pass
    `allowShellFallback: true`:

    ```typescript
    // Before
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({ candidate });

    // After
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({
      candidate,
      // Only set this for trusted compatibility callers that intentionally
      // accept shell-mediated fallback.
      allowShellFallback: true,
    });
    ```

    If your caller does not intentionally rely on shell fallback, do not set
    `allowShellFallback` and handle the thrown error instead.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find deprecated imports">
    ```bash
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/compat" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/infra-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/config-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "openclaw/extension-api" my-plugin/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace with focused imports">
    Check the exported name and typed-public contract as well as the import
    path. Some functions are renamed; not every retained helper or named type
    has a modern public replacement:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated backwards-compatibility layer)
    import {
      createChannelReplyPipeline,
      createPluginRuntimeStore,
    } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat";

    // After (modern focused imports)
    import {
      createChannelMessageReplyPipeline as createChannelReplyPipeline,
    } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-outbound";
    import { createPluginRuntimeStore } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-store";
    ```

    The explicit alias preserves existing `createChannelReplyPipeline(...)`
    call sites. The modern export is `createChannelMessageReplyPipeline`;
    see [Retained channel facade mappings](/plugins/sdk-migration#retained-channel-facade-mappings)
    for the remaining functions and named types.

    For host-side helpers, use the injected plugin runtime instead of
    importing directly:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated extension-api bridge)
    import { runEmbeddedAgent } from "openclaw/extension-api";
    const result = await runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });

    // After (injected runtime)
    const result = await api.runtime.agent.runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });
    ```

    Same pattern for other legacy bridge helpers:

    | Old import | Modern equivalent |
    | --- | --- |
    | `resolveAgentDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentDir` |
    | `resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` |
    | `resolveAgentIdentity` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentIdentity` |
    | `resolveThinkingDefault` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveThinkingDefault` |
    | `resolveAgentTimeoutMs` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentTimeoutMs` |
    | `ensureAgentWorkspace` | `api.runtime.agent.ensureAgentWorkspace` |
    | session store helpers | `api.runtime.agent.session.*` |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace broad infra-runtime imports">
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime` still exists for external
    compatibility, but new code should use the supported surface it actually
    needs:

    | Need | Typed-public import or injected API |
    | --- | --- |
    | New system event producers | `api.runtime.system.enqueueSystemEvent` |
    | Heartbeat wake requests | `api.runtime.system.requestHeartbeat` |
    | Channel activity telemetry | `api.runtime.channel.activity.record` and `.get` |
    | `createDedupeCache`, `resolveGlobalDedupeCache` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/dedupe-runtime` |
    | Safe local-file/media paths, regular-file checks, and symlink-parent checks | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/security-runtime` (itself a deprecated broad barrel) |
    | `fetchWithSsrFGuard`, pinned-dispatcher helpers, `LookupFn`, `SsrFPolicy` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/ssrf-runtime` |
    | Approval request/resolution types | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-runtime` |
    | Approval reply payload and command helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-reply-runtime` |
    | `collectErrorGraphCandidates`, `extractErrorCode`, `formatErrorMessage`, `formatUncaughtError`, `readErrorName`, `toErrorObject` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/error-runtime` |
    | `generateSecureToken`, `generateSecureUuid` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` |
    | `parseFiniteNumber`, `parseStrictFiniteNumber`, `parseStrictInteger`, `parseStrictNonNegativeInteger`, `parseStrictPositiveInteger` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/string-coerce-runtime` |

    These are symbol-specific mappings, not replacements for the whole barrel.
    Private-local entries such as `heartbeat-runtime`, `delivery-queue-runtime`,
    `fetch-runtime`, `runtime-fetch`, and `file-lock` are JavaScript-only host
    exports, not typed third-party APIs. Heartbeat event/summary/visibility
    helpers, pending-delivery drain, transport readiness, concurrency, and file
    locking do not have equivalent modern typed-public mappings here. Retain
    existing compatibility imports for those operations pending an SDK-owner
    decision.

    `fetchWithSsrFGuard` is not a drop-in replacement for dispatcher-aware fetch:
    it takes an options object and returns `{ response, finalUrl, release, ... }`,
    not a bare `Response`; callers must release its resources. The named types
    `PinnedDispatcherPolicy`, `GuardedFetchOptions`, and `GuardedFetchResult`
    are not exported by `ssrf-runtime`. Similarly, `dedupe-runtime` does not
    export the legacy `DedupeCache` or `DedupeCacheOptions` names. Migrate type
    usage explicitly rather than assuming a function move also moves its types.

    The error mapping does not cover `hasErrnoCode`, `isErrno`,
    `stringifyNonErrorCause`, `ErrorKind`, or `detectErrorKind`; the last helper
    preserves legacy substring classification. The numeric and random mappings
    likewise do not cover every timer, expiry, hex, fraction, or integer helper.
    Keep unsupported retained imports until their public contract is resolved.

    System event snapshot inspection and consume helpers remain available only
    through the deprecated `openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime` compatibility
    surface; there is no modern public replacement. Current snapshots carry an
    opaque `id` for one queued occurrence. Preserve it through copies and
    serialization when returning a snapshot to consume. Legacy ID-less callers
    retain structural matching, which can be ambiguous after queue churn. Do
    not treat the ID as persistent or valid across restarts.

    File-lock nesting is owner-scoped. Pass the same `reentrantOwner` only for
    nested acquisitions in one logical operation; omit it for ordinary locking.
    Never use a process-wide constant, because unrelated work would incorrectly
    share the critical section.

    Bundled plugins are scanner-guarded against `infra-runtime`, so repo code
    cannot regress to the broad barrel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate channel route helpers">
    New channel route code uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-route`. The older
    route-key names remain as compatibility aliases:

    | Old helper | Modern helper |
    | --- | --- |
    | `channelRouteIdentityKey(...)` | `channelRouteDedupeKey(...)` |
    | `channelRouteKey(...)` | `channelRouteCompactKey(...)` |

    The modern route helpers normalize `{ channel, to, accountId, threadId }`
    consistently across native approvals, reply suppression, inbound dedupe,
    cron delivery, and session routing.

    Channel plugins use `messaging.targetResolver.resolveTarget(...)` for target-id normalization
    and directory-miss fallback,
    `messaging.inferTargetChatType(...)` when core needs an early peer kind,
    and `messaging.resolveOutboundSessionRoute(...)` for provider-native
    session and thread identity.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and test">
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    pnpm test my-plugin/
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Import path reference

Use the topical SDK guides linked from [SDK overview](/plugins/sdk-overview)
and prefer the narrowest documented typed-public subpath. In `package.json`,
these subpaths have both `types` and `default` export targets.

The compiler inventory in `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entrypoints.json` also contains
private-local entries. Their classification is maintained in
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-private-local-only-subpaths.json`. Production-private
entries may have JavaScript-only `default` exports for bundled or separately
published official plugins, but their declarations are excluded from the package.
A runtime export or a source file is not a typed third-party SDK contract.

The mappings on this page are a migration subset, not the full SDK surface.
Check both the public subpath and its actual named exports before replacing an
import.

Reserved bundled-plugin helper seams have been retired from the public SDK
export map except for explicitly documented compatibility facades such as the
deprecated `plugin-sdk/discord` shim retained for external plugins that still
import the published `@openclaw/discord` package directly. Owner-specific
helpers live inside the owning plugin package; shared host behavior moves
through generic SDK contracts such as `plugin-sdk/gateway-runtime`,
`plugin-sdk/security-runtime`, and the injected plugin API.

Use the narrowest import that matches the job. If you cannot find an export,
check the source at `src/plugin-sdk/` or ask maintainers which generic
contract should own it.

### Retained channel facade mappings

The retained channel facades are not interchangeable with `channel-outbound`.
Migrate each function and type separately.

For `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-reply-pipeline`, use these exports from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-outbound`:

| Legacy export                                                                   | Modern export                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `createChannelReplyPipeline`                                                    | `createChannelMessageReplyPipeline`            |
| `resolveChannelSourceReplyDeliveryMode`                                         | `resolveChannelMessageSourceReplyDeliveryMode` |
| `createReplyPrefixContext`, `createReplyPrefixOptions`, `createTypingCallbacks` | Same names                                     |

These functions share their implementations with the retained facade. The named
types do not all move with them: `channel-outbound` does not export
`ChannelReplyPipeline`, `CreateTypingCallbacksParams`, `ReplyPrefixContext`,
`ReplyPrefixContextBundle`, `ReplyPrefixOptions`, or `TypingCallbacks`.
`SourceReplyDeliveryMode` is available from the typed-public
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/reply-runtime` subpath. Callers that still need the other
named imports must retain their compatibility type imports until an SDK owner
approves a public replacement; do not import the internal `channel-reply-core`
source file.

From `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-lifecycle`, these functions move unchanged to
`channel-outbound`: `createAccountStatusSink`, `createChannelRunQueue`,
`keepHttpServerTaskAlive`, `runPassiveAccountLifecycle`, `waitUntilAbort`,
`createDraftStreamLoop`, `createFinalizableDraftLifecycle`,
`createFinalizableDraftStreamControlsForState`, and `takeMessageIdAfterStop`.
Other lifecycle helpers need more than a path change:

| Retained helper                                       | Migration limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deliverFinalizableDraftPreview`                      | Adapt to `defineFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter` and `deliverWithFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter`. Move preview callbacks into `adapter` and handle an object result with `kind` and optional `liveState`, not the legacy string result. The adapter can return `preview-retained`; the legacy wrapper maps that kind to `normal-skipped`. |
| `createFinalizableDraftStreamControls`                | `createFinalizableDraftStreamControlsForState` requires a shared `{ stopped, final }` object instead of custom state getter/marker callbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `clearFinalizableDraftMessage`                        | Adopting `createFinalizableDraftLifecycle` changes cleanup ownership: it serializes clears and retains failed deletions for retry. `takeMessageIdAfterStop` only takes the ID; it does not delete the message.                                                                                                                         |
| `createRunStateMachine`, `createArmableStallWatchdog` | No modern public equivalents. Keep retained imports pending an SDK-owner decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The named types `ChannelRunQueue`, `ChannelRunQueueParams`,
`ChannelRunQueueTaskContext`, `DraftPreviewFinalizerDraft`,
`DraftPreviewFinalizerResult`, `DraftStreamLoop`, `FinalizableDraftStreamState`,
`ArmableStallWatchdog`, and `StallWatchdogTimeoutMeta` are not exported by
`channel-outbound`. Nor does it export `deliverFinalizableLivePreview`,
`LivePreviewFinalizerDraft`, or `LivePreviewFinalizerResult`, despite the legacy
finalizer annotations recommending them. Keep needed compatibility type imports;
inferred factory results are not necessarily identical to caller-implemented
legacy interfaces.

For `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message`, move outbound exports unchanged to
`channel-outbound`, but migrate its three dispatch aliases to
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound`:

| Legacy export                      | Modern inbound export               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `hasFinalChannelTurnDispatch`      | `hasFinalInboundReplyDispatch`      |
| `hasVisibleChannelTurnDispatch`    | `hasVisibleInboundReplyDispatch`    |
| `resolveChannelTurnDispatchCounts` | `resolveInboundReplyDispatchCounts` |

These aliases share their implementations and signatures. See
[Channel outbound API](/plugins/sdk-channel-outbound) for the outbound contract.

## Removed compatibility surfaces

The July 2026 sweep removed the root SDK and compat barrels, the extension API
bridge, the expired SDK subpath aliases, unused SDK subpaths, and typed-public
access to bundled-only SDK modules. Private-local build mappings remain for
repository owners, and production-private JavaScript exports support official
plugin runtimes. Neither provides typed third-party SDK access.

### Process-global API-provider publication

`registerApiProvider(...)` and `unregisterApiProviders(...)` were removed from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/llm`. They published API transports into process-global
state, which lifecycle-owned model runtimes then had to copy into each prepared
registry.

Provider plugins should register text-inference providers through
`api.registerProvider(...)`. Host-owned code and tests that construct an
`ApiRegistry` should register directly on that registry so provider ownership
and teardown stay scoped to the prepared runtime.

### Deactivate hook alias

The `api.on("deactivate", handler)` compatibility alias was removed. Register
the same shutdown cleanup with `gateway_stop`:

```typescript
// Before
api.on("deactivate", async (event, ctx) => {
  await stopPluginService(ctx);
});

// After
api.on("gateway_stop", async (event, ctx) => {
  await stopPluginService(ctx);
});
```

### Private testing barrel

`openclaw/plugin-sdk/testing` was repo-local and excluded from shipped package
artifacts, so it was removed before its 2026-07-28 `removeAfter` date. Repository
tests use focused subpaths such as `plugin-sdk/plugin-test-runtime`,
`plugin-sdk/channel-test-helpers`, `plugin-sdk/channel-target-testing`,
`plugin-sdk/test-env`, and `plugin-sdk/test-fixtures`.

## Migration reference

These mappings cover both removed July 2026 surfaces and later-window active
deprecations. A mapping is migration guidance, not evidence that the old
surface remains available; consult the compatibility registry and removal
timeline for current status.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="command-auth help builders -> command-status">
    **Old (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-auth`)**: `buildCommandsMessage`,
    `buildCommandsMessagePaginated`, `buildHelpMessage`.

    **New (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-status`)**: same signatures, imported
    from the narrower subpath. The `command-auth` compatibility re-exports
    have been removed.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    import { buildHelpMessage } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-auth";

    // After
    import { buildHelpMessage } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-status";
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mention gating helpers -> resolveInboundMentionDecision">
    **Old**: `resolveMentionGating(params)` and
    `resolveMentionGatingWithBypass(params)` from
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound` or
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-mention-gating`.

    **New**: `resolveInboundMentionDecision({ facts, policy })` - one decision
    object instead of two split call shapes.

    Adopted across Discord, iMessage, Matrix, MS Teams, QQBot, Signal,
    Telegram, WhatsApp, and Zalo. Slack's own `app_mention` event model does
    not use this helper.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Channel runtime shim and channel actions helpers">
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime` has been removed. Use
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime-context` for registering runtime
    objects.

    The native message schema helpers in `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-actions`
    were removed alongside raw "actions" channel exports. Expose capabilities
    through the semantic `presentation` surface instead - channel plugins
    declare what they render (cards, buttons, selects) rather than which raw
    action names they accept.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Web search provider tool() helper -> createTool() on the plugin">
    **Old**: `tool()` factory from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/provider-web-search`.

    **New**: implement `createTool(...)` directly on the provider plugin.
    OpenClaw no longer needs the SDK helper to register the tool wrapper.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plaintext channel envelopes -> BodyForAgent">
    **Old**: `api.runtime.channel.reply.formatInboundEnvelope(...)` (and the
    `channelEnvelope` field on inbound message objects) to build a flat
    plaintext prompt envelope from inbound channel messages.

    **New**: `BodyForAgent` plus structured user-context blocks. Channel
    plugins attach routing metadata (thread, topic, reply-to, reactions) as
    typed fields instead of concatenating them into a prompt string. The
    `formatAgentEnvelope(...)` helper is still supported for synthesized
    assistant-facing envelopes, but inbound plaintext envelopes are on the way
    out.

    Affected areas: `inbound_claim`, `message_received`, and any custom
    channel plugin that post-processed the old envelope text.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="subagent_spawning hook -> core thread binding">
    **Old**: `api.on("subagent_spawning", handler)` returning
    `threadBindingReady` or `deliveryOrigin`.

    **New**: let core prepare `thread: true` subagent bindings through the
    channel session-binding adapter. Use `api.on("subagent_spawned", handler)`
    only for post-launch observation.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    api.on("subagent_spawning", async () => ({
      status: "ok",
      threadBindingReady: true,
      deliveryOrigin: { channel: "discord", to: "channel:123", threadId: "456" },
    }));

    // After
    api.on("subagent_spawned", async (event) => {
      await observeSubagentLaunch(event);
    });
    ```

    The `subagent_spawning` hook and its event/result types were removed in
    August 2026 after thread binding moved to the core session-binding path.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider discovery types -> provider catalog types">
    Four discovery type aliases are now thin wrappers over the catalog-era
    types:

    | Old alias                 | New type                  |
    | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryOrder`  | `ProviderCatalogOrder`    |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryContext`| `ProviderCatalogContext`  |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryResult` | `ProviderCatalogResult`   |
    | `ProviderPluginDiscovery` | `ProviderPluginCatalog`   |

    The aliases and legacy `ProviderCapabilities` static bag have been
    removed. Provider plugins
    should use explicit provider hooks such as `buildReplayPolicy`,
    `normalizeToolSchemas`, and `wrapStreamFn` rather than a static object.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thinking policy hooks -> resolveThinkingProfile">
    **Old** (three separate hooks on `ProviderThinkingPolicy`):
    `isBinaryThinking(ctx)`, `supportsXHighThinking(ctx)`, and
    `resolveDefaultThinkingLevel(ctx)`.

    **New**: a single `resolveThinkingProfile(ctx)` that returns a
    `ProviderThinkingProfile` with the canonical `id`, optional `label`, and a
    ranked level list. OpenClaw downgrades stale stored values by profile rank
    automatically.

    The context includes `provider`, `modelId`, optional merged `reasoning`,
    and optional merged model `compat` facts. Provider plugins can use those
    catalog facts to expose a model-specific profile only when the configured
    request contract supports it.

    Implement one hook instead of three. The legacy hooks have been removed.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="External auth providers -> contracts.externalAuthProviders">
    **Old**: implementing external auth hooks without declaring the provider
    in the plugin manifest.

    **New**: declare `contracts.externalAuthProviders` in the plugin manifest
    **and** implement `resolveExternalAuthProfiles(...)`.

    ```json
    {
      "contracts": {
        "externalAuthProviders": ["anthropic", "openai"]
      }
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider env-var lookup -> setup.providers[].envVars">
    **Old** manifest field: `providerAuthEnvVars: { anthropic: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] }`.

    **New**: mirror the same env-var lookup into `setup.providers[].envVars`
    on the manifest. This consolidates setup/status env metadata in one place
    and avoids booting the plugin runtime just to answer env-var lookups.

    `providerAuthEnvVars` is no longer accepted.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory plugin registration -> registerMemoryCapability">
    **Old**: three separate calls - `api.registerMemoryPromptSection(...)`,
    `api.registerMemoryFlushPlan(...)`, `api.registerMemoryRuntime(...)`.

    **New**: one call on the memory-state API -
    `registerMemoryCapability(pluginId, { promptBuilder, flushPlanResolver, runtime })`.

    Same slots, single registration call. Additive prompt and corpus helpers
    (`registerMemoryPromptSupplement`, `registerMemoryCorpusSupplement`) are
    not affected.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory embedding provider API">
    **Old**: `api.registerMemoryEmbeddingProvider(...)` plus
    `contracts.memoryEmbeddingProviders`.

    **New**: `api.registerEmbeddingProvider(...)` plus
    `contracts.embeddingProviders`.

    The generic embedding provider contract is reusable outside memory and is
    the supported path for every provider. The memory-specific registration API
    and manifest contract were removed after the **2026-08-21** migration
    deadline.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Raw channel send results -> OutboundDeliveryResult">
    **Old**: return `{ ok, messageId, error }` through
    `ChannelSendRawResult` and normalize it with
    `createRawChannelSendResultAdapter(...)`.

    **New**: return `OutboundDeliveryResult` fields and attach the channel with
    `createAttachedChannelResultAdapter(...)`. Failed sends should throw instead
    of returning an error string. Put the platform destination in
    `target: { kind: "chat" | "channel" | "room" | "conversation", id }`;
    the old parallel `chatId`, `channelId`, `roomId`, and `conversationId`
    result fields are no longer accepted. The raw result type remains available
    until the next plugin-SDK major release.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subagent session messages types renamed">
    Two legacy type aliases still exported from `src/plugins/runtime/types.ts`:

    | Old                           | New                             |
    | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | `SubagentReadSessionParams`   | `SubagentGetSessionMessagesParams` |
    | `SubagentReadSessionResult`   | `SubagentGetSessionMessagesResult` |

    The runtime method `readSession` is deprecated in favor of
    `getSessionMessages`. Same signature; the old method calls through to the
    new one.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Removed session and transcript file APIs">
    The SQLite session/transcript flip removes or deprecates plugin-facing APIs
    that exposed active `sessions.json` stores, JSONL transcript paths, or lists
    of session files. Runtime plugins should use session identity and SDK runtime
    helpers instead of resolving or mutating active files.

    | Migrating surface | Replacement |
    | ----------------- | ----------- |
    | Deprecated `loadSessionStore(...)`, `updateSessionStore(...)`, and `resolveSessionStoreEntry(...)`, including package-root `loadSessionStore(...)` | `getSessionEntry(...)`, `listSessionEntries(...)`, and row-level session mutations. |
    | Deprecated `resolveSessionFilePath(...)` | Session identity (`sessionKey`, `sessionId`, and SDK runtime target helpers) plus Gateway methods that operate on the current session. |
    | Deprecated package-root `saveSessionStore(...)` and removed SDK file-store writes | Gateway-owned session runtime APIs; plugin code should request or mutate session state through documented runtime/context helpers instead of writing the active store file. |
    | Removed `resolveSessionTranscriptPathInDir(...)` and `resolveAndPersistSessionFile(...)` | Session identity and Gateway methods that operate on the current session. |
    | `readLatestAssistantTextFromSessionTranscript(...)` | Identity-backed transcript readers exposed by the current runtime context, or Gateway history/session methods when the plugin is outside the transcript owner path. |
    | `SessionTranscriptUpdate.sessionFile` | `SessionTranscriptUpdate.target` with `agentId`, `sessionKey`, and `sessionId`. |
    | Memory sync inputs such as `sessionFiles` | Identity-backed transcript/session sources provided by the host; do not crawl active JSONL files for live sessions. |
    | Runtime options named `transcriptPath` or `sessionFile` for active sessions | `sessionTarget`/runtime target objects that carry storage-neutral session identity. |

    Legacy JSONL transcript files remain valid as import, archive, export, and
    support artifacts. They are no longer the steady-state runtime contract for
    active sessions.

    Official plugins released with `v2026.7.1-beta.5` imported the four
    deprecated helpers above. `openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-store-runtime` keeps
    that exact bridge through 2026-10-12; new plugins must use the replacements.
    `resolveStorePath(...)` remains a supported SDK helper and is not part of
    this deprecation.

    `openclaw plugins inspect --all --runtime` reports non-bundled plugins whose
    load errors or diagnostics still reference these removed file APIs. The
    `@openclaw/plugin-inspector` advisory sweep must use version `0.3.17` or
    newer so external package scans also flag whole-store session helpers,
    session file-path helpers, legacy transcript file targets, and low-level
    transcript helpers before release.

  <Accordion title="Agent harness attempt params -> V2 host-capability contract">
    New or updated harness plugins should implement `AgentHarnessV2` and use
    `AgentHarnessAttemptParamsV2`, `EmbeddedRunAttemptParamsV2`, or
    `AgentHarnessSideQuestionParamsV2`. The V2 parameter types require
    `hostCapabilities`, matching what core supplies at the selected-harness
    boundary. A plugin that adopts these V2 contracts must declare
    `openclaw.compat.pluginApi: ">=2026.8.1"` (or a newer floor) in its package
    manifest so an older host rejects the plugin before loading it.

    Existing plugins may continue implementing `AgentHarness` and constructing
    the legacy `AgentHarnessAttemptParams`, `EmbeddedRunAttemptParams`, or
    `AgentHarnessSideQuestionParams` types without that field through
    2026-10-12. Those contracts keep the capability optional only for source
    compatibility; they do not create a capability-free runtime path. Migrate
    by changing the imported type name and binding tool or native-action surfaces through
    `params.hostCapabilities`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="runtime.tasks.flow -> runtime.tasks.managedFlows">
    **Old**: `runtime.tasks.flow` (singular) returned a live task-flow
    accessor.

    **New**: `runtime.tasks.managedFlows` keeps the managed TaskFlow mutation
    runtime for plugins that create, update, cancel, or run child tasks from a
    flow. Use `runtime.tasks.flows` when the plugin only needs DTO-based
    reads.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    const flow = api.runtime.tasks.flow.fromToolContext(ctx);
    // After
    const flow = api.runtime.tasks.managedFlows.fromToolContext(ctx);
    ```

    The legacy aliases were removed in July 2026.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Embedded extension factories -> agent tool-result middleware">
    Covered in [How to migrate](#how-to-migrate) above. Included here for
    completeness: the removed embedded-runner-only
    `api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)` path is replaced by
    `api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(...)` with an explicit runtime list
    in `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenClawSchemaType alias -> OpenClawConfig">
    The `OpenClawSchemaType` root-SDK alias was removed. Use the canonical
    `OpenClawConfig` name.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    import type { OpenClawSchemaType } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk";
    // After
    import type { OpenClawConfig } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-contracts";
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Extension-level deprecations (inside bundled channel/provider plugins under
`extensions/`) are tracked inside their own `api.ts` and `runtime-api.ts`
barrels. They do not affect third-party plugin contracts and are not listed
here. If you consume a bundled plugin's local barrel directly, read the
deprecation comments in that barrel before upgrading.

## Talk and realtime voice migration

Realtime voice, telephony, meeting, and browser Talk code shares one Talk
session controller exported by `openclaw/plugin-sdk/realtime-voice`. The
controller owns the common Talk event envelope, active turn state, capture
state, output-audio state, recent event history, and stale-turn rejection.
Provider plugins own vendor-specific realtime sessions. Browser-meeting plugins
use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/meeting-runtime` for session, browser, audio, node-host,
agent-consult, and voice-call mechanics, then implement `MeetingPlatformAdapter`
for URL rules, DOM scripts, manual-action mapping, captions, creation, and dial-in
plans. Platform REST APIs, OAuth, artifacts, selectors, and wire names remain in
the plugin. Browser permission plans receive the requested meeting URL so each
platform can grant only its exact supported origins. Session runtimes must also
normalize platform-specific live health after confirmed browser departure;
historical transcript fields may remain, but caption and audio readiness must
not stay active after leave.

All bundled surfaces run on the shared controller: browser relay,
managed-room handoff, voice-call realtime, voice-call streaming STT, Google
Meet realtime, and native push-to-talk. Gateway advertises one live Talk event
channel in `hello-ok.features.events`: `talk.event`.

New code should not call `createTalkEventSequencer(...)` directly unless
implementing a low-level adapter or test fixture. Use the shared controller so
turn-scoped events cannot be emitted without a turn id, stale `turnEnd` /
`turnCancel` calls cannot clear a newer active turn, and output-audio
lifecycle events stay consistent across telephony, meetings, browser relay,
managed-room handoff, and native Talk clients.

The public API shape:

```typescript
// Gateway-owned Talk session API.
await gateway.request("talk.session.create", {
  mode: "realtime",
  transport: "gateway-relay",
  brain: "agent-consult",
  sessionKey: "main",
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.appendAudio", { sessionId, audioBase64 });
// Capture this before stopping playback from the active output `talk.event`.
const turnId = activeOutputTalkEvent.talkEvent.turnId;
await gateway.request("talk.session.cancelOutput", { sessionId, turnId, reason: "barge-in" });
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", {
  sessionId,
  callId,
  result: { status: "working" },
  options: { willContinue: true },
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", {
  sessionId,
  callId,
  result: { status: "already_delivered" },
  options: { suppressResponse: true },
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", { sessionId, callId, result });
await gateway.request("talk.session.close", { sessionId });

// Client-owned provider session API.
await gateway.request("talk.client.create", {
  mode: "realtime",
  transport: "webrtc",
  brain: "agent-consult",
  sessionKey: "main",
});
await gateway.request("talk.client.toolCall", { sessionKey, callId, name, args });
await gateway.request("talk.client.steer", { sessionKey, text, mode: "steer" });
```

Browser-owned WebRTC/provider-websocket sessions use `talk.client.create`,
because the browser owns provider negotiation and media transport while the
Gateway owns credentials, instructions, and tool policy. `talk.session.*` is
the common Gateway-managed surface for gateway-relay realtime, gateway-relay
transcription, and managed-room native STT/TTS sessions.

Legacy configs that place realtime selectors beside `talk.provider` /
`talk.providers` should be repaired with `openclaw doctor --fix`; runtime Talk
does not reinterpret speech/TTS provider config as realtime provider config.

The supported `talk.session.create` combinations are intentionally small:

| Mode            | Transport       | Brain           | Owner              | Notes                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `realtime`      | `gateway-relay` | `agent-consult` | Gateway            | Full-duplex provider audio bridged through the Gateway; tool calls route through the agent-consult tool.           |
| `transcription` | `gateway-relay` | `none`          | Gateway            | Streaming STT only; callers send input audio and receive transcript events.                                        |
| `stt-tts`       | `managed-room`  | `agent-consult` | Native/client room | Push-to-talk and walkie-talkie style rooms where the client owns capture/playback and the Gateway owns turn state. |
| `stt-tts`       | `managed-room`  | `direct-tools`  | Native/client room | Admin-only room mode for trusted first-party surfaces that execute Gateway tool actions directly.                  |

Method map for readers migrating from the older `talk.realtime.*` /
`talk.transcription.*` / `talk.handoff.*` families (all removed):

| Old                              | New                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `talk.realtime.session`          | `talk.client.create`                                 |
| `talk.realtime.toolCall`         | `talk.client.toolCall`                               |
| `talk.realtime.relayAudio`       | `talk.session.appendAudio`                           |
| `talk.realtime.relayCancel`      | `talk.session.cancelOutput`                          |
| `talk.realtime.relayToolResult`  | `talk.session.submitToolResult`                      |
| `talk.realtime.relayStop`        | `talk.session.close`                                 |
| `talk.transcription.session`     | `talk.session.create({ mode: "transcription" })`     |
| `talk.transcription.relayAudio`  | `talk.session.appendAudio`                           |
| `talk.transcription.relayCancel` | `talk.session.close`                                 |
| `talk.transcription.relayStop`   | `talk.session.close`                                 |
| `talk.handoff.create`            | `talk.session.create({ transport: "managed-room" })` |
| `talk.handoff.revoke`            | `talk.session.close`                                 |

The unified control vocabulary is also deliberately narrow:

| Method                          | Applies to                                              | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `talk.session.appendAudio`      | `realtime/gateway-relay`, `transcription/gateway-relay` | Append a base64 PCM audio chunk to the provider session owned by the same Gateway connection.                                                                                                                             |
| `talk.session.cancelOutput`     | `realtime/gateway-relay`                                | Stop assistant audio output without necessarily ending the user turn.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `talk.session.submitToolResult` | `realtime/gateway-relay`                                | Complete a provider tool call after any asynchronous completion exposed by its bridge; pass `options.willContinue` for interim output or, when supported, `options.suppressResponse` to avoid another assistant response. |
| `talk.session.steer`            | agent-backed Talk sessions                              | Send spoken `status`, `steer`, `cancel`, or `followup` control to the active embedded run resolved from the Talk session.                                                                                                 |
| `talk.session.close`            | all unified sessions                                    | Stop relay sessions or revoke managed-room state, then forget the unified session id.                                                                                                                                     |

Do not introduce provider or platform special cases in core to make this work.
Core owns Talk session semantics. Provider plugins own vendor session setup.
Voice-call and Google Meet own telephony/meeting adapters. Browser and native
apps own device capture/playback UX.

| **Pending owner decision**                               | Records without `removeAfter` or `removalGate` remain deprecated and ineligible until their owner publishes a gate.                                                          |
| **Day after a `deprecated` record's `removeAfter` date** | At 00:00 UTC, that record becomes date-eligible and `pnpm plugins:boundary-report --fail-on-eligible-compat` exits non-zero. The date itself is the final compatibility day. |
| **A `removal-pending` record's `removeAfter` date**      | At 00:00 UTC, the report marks the record due for review and lists its blockers. It does not trigger the compatibility fail flag.                                            |
| **Next Plugin SDK major**                                | `inbound-reply-dispatch` reaches its explicit `next-plugin-sdk-major` gate; it is not date-eligible before that version boundary.                                            |

The remaining public SDK subpaths below have registry-backed removal windows.
The July 30 rows were removed after their early maintainer-authorized sweep:
unused subpaths were deleted, earlier compatibility aliases were deleted, and
bundled-only modules were demoted to private-local build mappings.

The August 15 compatibility subpaths `agent-config-primitives`,
`channel-logging`, `channel-secret-runtime`, `channel-streaming`,
`group-access`, `matrix`, `text-runtime`, and `zod` were retired early by
explicit SDK-owner approval in August 2026. Use the focused replacements in
the [Plugin SDK subpath catalog](/plugins/sdk-subpaths), and import `zod`
directly from the `zod` package. `inbound-reply-dispatch` remains available
until the next Plugin SDK major.

The five September 1 subpaths remain available in 2026.8.2 under an approved
retention exception; that release’s registry still labels them `deprecated`.
For 2026.9.1, the release maintainer approved renewing their `removeAfter` date
from `2026-09-01` to `2026-10-01` on September 2, 2026. The registry keeps them
`removal-pending` with the same replacement mappings. Removal awaits verification
that supported external plugins have migrated. `infra-runtime` additionally retains
system-event snapshot inspection and consumption until a modern public replacement
exists. This changes compatibility tracking only, not the exported SDK or runtime
behavior.

Bundled-plugin migration does not prove that every external caller can use a
path-only replacement. Migrate the functions with verified typed-public mappings;
keep retained imports where a named type or required behavior still lacks a
public replacement and ask the SDK owner to resolve that gap. Run
`pnpm plugins:boundary-report` to see the dates, gates, and blockers for the
surfaces your plugin uses.

Runtime contract for Codex harness turns. For setup and routing, see
[Codex harness](/plugins/codex-harness). For config fields, see
[Codex harness reference](/plugins/codex-harness-reference).

## Overview

Codex owns the native model loop, native thread resume, native tool
continuation, and native compaction. OpenClaw owns channel routing, session
files, visible message delivery, OpenClaw dynamic tools, approvals, media
delivery, and a transcript mirror around that boundary.

For native connected apps, Codex also owns the final per-thread app and tool
policy. OpenClaw caches a runtime-and-workspace-scoped `plugin/installed`
snapshot, reads exact configured plugin details, provisionally admits only
explicitly allowed, ownership-proven apps, and creates a deny-by-default
native thread. One `app/installed` request verifies the actual thread ID
without forcing an inventory refresh. Missing, disabled, or non-callable apps
produce one warning; the conversation continues with the remaining tools.
Codex still enforces app and tool permissions for the actual thread.

This check finishes before OpenClaw injects history, starts a turn, or commits a
thread binding. If the snapshot request fails, persistent provisional threads
are deleted and ephemeral threads are unsubscribed. OpenClaw retires the app-server connection when safe
cleanup cannot be confirmed. Supervised branches also clean up their temporary
probe and preserve recovery state if cleanup fails.

Account-wide app access cannot override an explicitly disabled configured
workspace plugin. OpenClaw uses its installed snapshot and reads only that
exact plugin's details to identify and deny its apps; it never scans unrelated
marketplaces or activates the plugin.

Prompt routing follows the selected runtime, not just the provider string. A
native Codex turn gets Codex app-server developer instructions; an explicit
OpenClaw compatibility route keeps the normal OpenClaw system prompt even when
it uses Codex-flavored OpenAI auth or transport.

OpenClaw starts and resumes native Codex threads with Codex's built-in
personality disabled (`personality: "none"`) so workspace personality files
and OpenClaw agent identity stay authoritative. Native Codex keeps Codex-owned
base/model instructions and project-doc loading otherwise. An ordinary
policy-restricted turn has no native filesystem environment, so OpenClaw carries
the bounded workspace `AGENTS.md` snapshot as thread-level developer
instructions instead. Lightweight, ring-zero, message-only, and tool-disabled
internal turns suppress project-doc loading and that fallback carrier.

OpenClaw developer instructions cover OpenClaw runtime concerns: source-channel
delivery, OpenClaw dynamic tools, ACP delegation, adapter context, and the
active agent workspace profile files. Skill catalogs and tool-routed
`MEMORY.md` pointers are projected as turn-scoped collaboration developer
instructions. When memory tools are unavailable, active `BOOTSTRAP.md` content
and full `MEMORY.md` fall back to plain turn input context instead.

Delivery mode and the current message target requirement arrive as compact
application context before each user turn. They explicitly supersede earlier
delivery guidance while preserving permission and temporal context. With the
same available tools, switching between automatic replies and message-tool-only
replies keeps the static instructions and message tool definition unchanged.
If the message tool is unavailable on a message-tool-only turn, final text stays
private to the invoking workflow; it is not delivered to the source conversation.

When `openclaw_direct.sessions_yield` is available, those instructions also
tell a native Codex parent to end the current turn when a child's result should
arrive in a later turn. Native `wait_agent` remains for an intentional same-turn
wait when the immediate next step is blocked on the child; completion polling
loops are not a substitute.

Most OpenClaw dynamic tools use the searchable `openclaw` namespace. Tools
marked `catalogMode: "direct-only"` use `openclaw_direct`, which Codex keeps
directly model-visible as `DirectModelOnly` instead of exposing it to nested
Code Mode execution.

Tool-schema repairs preserve literal property and definition names, including
`__proto__`. The schema advertised to Codex and the schema used to validate
OpenClaw tool calls retain the same required fields and constraints.

For a [managed GitHub identity](/gateway/config-tools#tools.github), `gateway_exec` uses OpenClaw's private local process-launch credential binding. Native Codex shell instead receives only the non-secret `GH_CONFIG_DIR` and token-clearing overlay; a missing or tokenless profile can still let GitHub CLI fall back to the OS keyring. Status and Gateway-owned publication guarantees do not cover that native shell path. Use `gateway_exec` when launch-bound managed GitHub credentials are required.

## Recovery after a hard Gateway stop

On POSIX systems, OpenClaw checks for registered orphaned Codex app-server
processes before spawning each fresh stdio child. Gateway startup also runs a
best-effort background sweep; the before-spawn check remains authoritative.
OpenClaw records the parent and child process identities in the current state
directory's SQLite plugin store
before sending Codex `initialize`, so a child cannot start a native turn before
its registration is durable.

Cleanup only targets a registered child whose original OpenClaw parent is no
longer running. It checks process IDs, start times, and process groups before
terminating the orphan and its discoverable descendants. When recorded, a
fingerprint of the child command line must also match the live process before
signaling; the durable registration stores only that digest, never the raw
arguments. Another live
OpenClaw instance, processes registered under another state directory, and externally
managed WebSocket or Unix-socket app-servers are left alone. These portable
process checks do not provide an atomic operating-system ownership guarantee
or discover descendants that independently reparented before inspection.

Linux reads process identities directly from `/proc`, including the boot ID
and process start ticks, so Alpine/BusyBox installations do not need `procps`.
Startup identity and command inspection share a 10-second deadline. During Linux
startup, an empty command line waits within that deadline while the same live
process identity remains valid. Registration still
requires a usable command fingerprint; unreadable or changed identities fail.
macOS uses its native `ps` with a fixed locale and timezone. Registration checks
inspect only the observer and the relevant parent and child processes; an
unrelated unreadable process does not block those checks. Destructive cleanup
still requires full process-tree inspection and fresh identity checks before
signaling.

If a required process cannot be inspected or bounded cleanup cannot confirm that
the registered orphan is gone, the new stdio connection fails instead of spawning
another child. Follow the reported reason: a deadline failure calls for checking
host load and Gateway logs, while an access-denied failure calls for checking
`/proc` access on Linux or `ps` permissions on macOS. Other inspection failures
require checking that the process-inspection facility is available and returning
usable data. Do not broaden permissions to address a timeout. If cleanup cannot
stop a verified orphan, inspect and stop that process before retrying. If the
cleanup budget expires, retry to finish the remaining registrations.

This recovery requires a spawn-time registration. It does not discover
unregistered children left by an older OpenClaw version or scan command names
to infer ownership. Windows does not yet have equivalent orphan registration
and recovery.

## Thread bindings and model changes

When an OpenClaw session is attached to an existing Codex thread, the next
turn resends the currently selected model, approval policy, sandbox,
approvals reviewer, and service tier to app-server. Switching from
`openai/gpt-5.5` to `openai/gpt-5.2` keeps the thread binding but asks Codex to
continue with the newly selected model.

Supervised bindings are the exception. The OpenClaw model picker stays locked,
and resumes omit model and provider overrides so Codex restores the canonical
thread's persisted model and provider. A separate native Codex control can
change that persisted pair, and the initial snapshot can produce Codex's normal
model-difference warning; the outer OpenClaw model and fallback chain never
substitute for either.

## Supervision and safe continuation

Codex supervision is an opt-in capability of the same `codex` plugin. It discovers
native threads through a separate connection and projects only non-archived
sessions into the Gateway catalog. Without explicit `appServer` connection
settings, that connection uses managed user-home stdio while the ordinary
harness remains agent-scoped. Listing and metadata reads are passive: they do
not resume a thread, subscribe OpenClaw to its live events, or answer its
approvals.

For a stored or idle session on the Gateway computer, **Continue as branch**
creates a normal, model-locked Chat and mirrors bounded user and assistant
history through the source's last terminal persisted turn. The first normal
Chat turn installs the real approval handlers and uses an ephemeral native fork
to pin the snapshot without a model or provider override. Codex App Server uses
its current native configuration and returns the selected pair; it emits its
normal warning if that model differs from the source's last recorded model.
OpenClaw confirms the fork's subscription is released before starting the canonical
`appServer`-source Codex harness thread under its cwd and runtime policy with
exactly the returned model and provider for that initial start. It then injects the
bounded visible history and commits the binding on the same supervision connection.
The probe is never persisted or archived. The source is never
resumed. The canonical thread has the full OpenClaw harness tool surface;
reasoning, tool calls, and tool results from the source are not cloned into it.
The private connection scope survives pending and committed binding states, so
every later turn remains on that connection with native auth and provider
configuration. Disabled supervision or binding/connection drift fails closed
rather than switching to the ordinary agent-home harness.

The original CLI, VS Code, Atlas, or ChatGPT source remains eligible for both
catalogs. The canonical branch is a native Codex thread, but its source kind is
`appServer`; native clients may filter that source kind, so its appearance in
Codex Desktop is not guaranteed.

Active sources cannot start a new branch or be archived; an existing supervised
Chat can still be opened. `notLoaded` means activity is unknown, not idle;
OpenClaw allows archive for a local `idle` or `notLoaded` row only after explicit
no-other-runner confirmation and a fresh process-local status read. Codex
serializes thread mutations within one App Server process but does not provide
an exclusive cross-process runner or approval-owner lease, so that read cannot
prove that another process is not using the thread. OpenClaw blocks a known
active binding owner for the exact target or any non-archived spawned descendant
returned by Codex's paginated descendant query. Enumeration errors, cycles, and
safety-limit exhaustion fail closed. Native archive can still race a new turn
in another process, so confirmation covers unknown clients and the gap between
status read and archive. A supervised model-locked Chat cannot be deleted while
it protects the native binding.

Paired-node catalogs expose bounded, paginated transcripts. Eligible stored or
idle rows can also create or reopen a model-locked Chat when the connected node
advertises and permits the catalog list, transcript read, and
`codex.cli.session.resume` commands, and the operator has `operator.admin`.
Later messages resume the exact native thread through the node's Codex CLI and
return its final text; this is not the Gateway-local branch flow or a streaming
App Server harness bridge. Nodes without those capabilities remain readable
without continuation, and paired-node archive remains unavailable. See
[paired-node limits](/plugins/codex-supervision#understand-paired-node-limits).

See [Codex supervision](/plugins/codex-supervision) for operator setup and the
visible Control UI behavior.

## Visible replies and heartbeats

Direct/source chat turns through the Codex harness default to automatic final
assistant delivery for internal WebChat surfaces, matching the Pi harness
contract: the agent replies normally and OpenClaw posts the final text to the
source conversation. Set `messages.visibleReplies: "message_tool"` to keep
final assistant text private unless the agent calls `message(action="send")`.

Codex heartbeat turns get `heartbeat_respond` in the searchable OpenClaw tool
catalog by default so the agent can record whether the wake should stay quiet
or notify. Heartbeat turns use the same Codex Default collaboration mode as
ordinary chat turns. The heartbeat monitor's cron scratch is appended to the
scheduled heartbeat user message when present.

## Final answers after settled tool work

For ordinary host-authenticated Codex turns that finish tool work without a
visible answer, OpenClaw can request a bounded final-answer turn in a private
temporary home. It uses the completed thread's model selection and the original
host auth route or resolved profile, rather than selecting a model from outer
request metadata. The existing environment, dynamic-tool, MCP, and native-hook
restrictions remain. Completed actions are transcript evidence, not instructions
to replay. Preserving a native model does not, by itself, disable host-authenticated
finalization.

A Chat created through Codex Sessions is different: its private supervision
connection owns native authentication. Stock Codex does not expose a generic
tool-free summary operation that preserves that connection's account. OpenClaw
marks this finalization context unavailable instead of choosing host credentials,
copying native credentials, or starting another native turn. If a final reply is
required, the host delivers its existing fallback:

> The tool run finished, but no final summary was produced. I did not repeat any completed actions.

The original completed outcome, native binding, and tool receipts remain intact.
Native turns that return a final answer are delivered normally. The ordinary
`homeScope: "user"` opt-in retains its documented private host-auth finalization;
see [Auth and environment isolation](/plugins/codex-harness-reference#auth-and-environment-isolation).

## Hook boundaries

For ordinary persistent conversations, a `before_prompt_build` result containing
`systemPrompt` replaces the complete OpenClaw generic developer policy. An explicit
empty string withdraws that policy. Unchanged, configuration-proven warm threads
stay warm, with the retained subscription and host authority rechecked after plugin
policy awaits. A closed or archived thread cannot be reused merely because its
connection is still open. Cold resumes and changed-policy resumes preserve the native thread and
history, verify that Codex unloaded the previous configuration, then append a
complete superseding policy message before admitting the turn. Historical policy
text can remain in the transcript; the later policy explicitly supersedes it.

If another client lease, subscriber, or failed native unload prevents configuration
proof, the turn stops before inference. A prewrite ownership refusal keeps the
healthy shared client and its other conversations available. External WebSocket,
Unix-socket, and stdio-proxy connections do not prove exclusive native-process
ownership, so ordinary conversations cannot perform this guarded cold refresh on
those transports. Use OpenClaw-managed local stdio; for lease contention, stop
competing native work before reconnecting. Policy refusals and uncertain or
acknowledged policy-write failures preserve the conversation and stop automatic
auth-profile, model-fallback, and whole-turn retries.

Supervised external connections retain their existing shared connection-lease
semantics; existing native-home and tool-catalog restrictions still apply. Those
lease checks do not establish exclusive ownership
of the external native process; strengthening that guarantee is a separate
limitation, not part of ordinary policy refresh. Manual ordinary adoption still
requires its agent-home and tool-catalog checks as well as native-process proof.

Ordinary incognito conversations retain their live ephemeral history. Stock Codex
cannot update their generic session configuration or resume them from disk, so a
changed or explicitly emptied generic policy stops the next turn before inference.
Restore the previous policy to continue the conversation, or start a
new incognito conversation for the new policy. Unchanged-policy turns continue;
this check adds no idle expiry or persistence to incognito history.

Preflight refusals keep the normal external-chat diagnostic privacy and group
silence policy. Verbose mode can show bounded recovery detail; Control UI retains
its usual diagnostic rendering. An externally closed ephemeral thread cannot be
promised recoverable.

| Codex native hooks                    | Codex                    | Low-level Codex lifecycle and native tool policy from Codex config. |

OpenClaw does not use project or global Codex `hooks.json` files to route
plugin behavior. For the native tool and permission bridge, OpenClaw injects
per-thread Codex config for `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`,
and `Stop`.

When Codex app-server approvals are enabled (`approvalPolicy` is not
`"never"`), the default injected native hook config omits `PermissionRequest`
so Codex's app-server reviewer and OpenClaw's approval bridge handle real
escalations after review. Add `permission_request` to
`nativeHookRelay.events` to force the compatibility relay anyway. Other Codex
hooks such as `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` remain Codex-level
controls; they are not exposed as OpenClaw plugin hooks in the v1 contract.

For OpenClaw dynamic tools, OpenClaw executes the tool after Codex asks for
the call, so plugin and middleware behavior runs in the harness adapter. Codex
Code Mode receives generic dynamic results as text and serializes nested
dynamic calls; callers must parse JSON-looking results and cannot rely on
`Promise.all` for concurrent submission. For Codex-native tools, Codex owns the
canonical tool record; OpenClaw can mirror selected events but cannot rewrite
the native thread unless Codex exposes that through app-server or native hook
callbacks.

Codex app-server report-mode `PreToolUse` events defer plugin approval to the
matching app-server approval. If an OpenClaw `before_tool_call` hook returns
`requireApproval` while the native payload sets `openclaw_approval_mode:
"report"`, the native hook relay records the plugin approval requirement and
returns no native decision. When Codex later sends the app-server approval
request for the same tool use, OpenClaw opens the plugin approval prompt and
maps the decision back to Codex. Codex `PermissionRequest` events are a
separate approval path and can still route through OpenClaw approvals when
configured for that bridge.

Codex app-server item notifications also provide async `after_tool_call`
observations for native tool completions not already covered by the native
`PostToolUse` relay. These are telemetry/compatibility only; they cannot
block, delay, or mutate the native tool call.

Compaction and LLM lifecycle projections come from Codex app-server
notifications and OpenClaw adapter state, not native Codex hook commands.
`before_compaction`, `after_compaction`, `llm_input`, and `llm_output` are
adapter-level observations, not byte-for-byte captures of Codex's internal
request or compaction payloads.

Codex native `hook/started` and `hook/completed` app-server notifications are
projected as `codex_app_server.hook` agent events for trajectory and
debugging. They do not invoke OpenClaw plugin hooks.

## Experimental sandbox process streaming

Native sandbox execution remains opt-in through
`appServer.experimental.sandboxExecServer`. When enabled for an active
OpenClaw sandbox, sandboxed processes stream ordered stdout, stderr, or PTY
output notifications. OpenClaw retains only a bounded recent-output buffer for
polling and replay, so long-running processes cannot grow the app-server bridge
without limit. Process exit and cleanup remain tied to the sandbox-owned
process. Failed environment registration never falls back to host execution.

See [Sandboxed native execution](/plugins/codex-harness-reference#sandboxed-native-execution)
for configuration and local-only transport restrictions.

Node-backed `remote-exec`, whether on a paired device or the same Crabbox cloud
profile used for OpenClaw worker turns, is separate from the experimental
local sandbox flag. Codex app-server and model auth stay on the Gateway, while
an explicitly authorized managed exec-server on the enrolled node owns
process, filesystem, capability, and credential-free HTTP operations. The
Gateway rejects authentication, cookie, API-key, and other sensitive HTTP
headers before they reach the node; authenticated HTTP must run on the
Gateway. The existing duplex node channel carries the Codex JSON-RPC stream
without starting an OpenClaw worker child or consuming a worker slot. Explicit
Gateway command allowlisting remains required. Launch needs per-attempt
allow-once approval or exact admitted session Full access with node-local
full/off policy. Full access never overrides local deny, ask, or allowlist
restrictions, pairing, hosting consent, command authorization, or tool policy.
The node rechecks local policy immediately before spawning the pinned binary;
a stale launch is refused. Each attempt owns an isolated Gateway app-server client so its
remote environment registration retires with that attempt. Disconnect ends the
active attempt and its remote processes; reconnect allows only a fresh
attempt. Normal Codex turns work, but `/btw` side questions fail closed because
they are not yet placement-bound. The placement workspace does not confine
execution: process and filesystem access remain bounded only by the node's
operating system account.

| Prompt and context plugins                    | Supported                                                                        | OpenClaw projects OpenClaw-specific prompt/context into the Codex turn while normally leaving Codex-owned base, model, and configured project-doc prompts in the native Codex lane. For ordinary policy-restricted turns without a native filesystem environment, OpenClaw carries the bounded workspace `AGENTS.md` snapshot as thread-level developer instructions. Ring-zero and other context-restricted internal modes suppress both paths. OpenClaw disables Codex's built-in personality for native threads so agent workspace personality files remain authoritative. Native Codex developer instructions accept only command guidance explicitly scoped to `codex_app_server`; legacy global command hints remain for non-Codex prompt surfaces. |

## Native permissions and MCP elicitations

For `PermissionRequest`, OpenClaw only returns explicit allow or deny
decisions when policy decides. A no-decision result is not an allow: Codex
treats it as no hook decision and falls through to its own guardian or user
approval path.

Codex app-server approval modes omit this native hook by default. This
applies unless `permission_request` is explicitly included in
`nativeHookRelay.events` or a compatibility runtime installs it.

When an operator chooses `allow-always` for a Codex native permission
request, OpenClaw remembers that exact provider/session/tool input/cwd
fingerprint for a bounded session window. The remembered decision is
intentionally exact-match only: a changed command, arguments, tool payload, or
cwd creates a fresh approval.

Codex MCP tool approval elicitations route through OpenClaw's plugin approval
flow when Codex marks `_meta.codex_approval_kind` as `"mcp_tool_call"`.
Plugin, account, Computer Use, and MCP approval classification runs before
ordinary input handling. A denied policy or unmappable approval schema returns
an explicit decline and never becomes a general-purpose form.

OpenClaw supports app-server MCP elicitation modes `form`, `openai/form`, and
`url`. Standard and extended forms can contain at most 12 fields. OpenClaw
normalizes field names to Gateway-safe question IDs, retains the original names
in accepted content, and presents fields in sequential batches of up to three.
Each field may offer at most four choices; fields and choices over those limits
are declined rather than truncated. Supported fields are free-form strings,
string `enum` or `oneOf` choices, booleans, numbers and integers, and
multi-select string arrays. Free-form string values are limited to 4,096
characters. String length, `email`, `uri`, `date`, and
`date-time` constraints and numeric or array bounds are validated before an
accepted response is returned. Optional fields, required fields, and valid
defaults retain their schema meaning.

`openai/form` also supports a single-select `openai/imagePicker` field with up
to four bounded item IDs and titles. OpenClaw uses only those IDs and titles; it
does not fetch or render item images. An unknown extended field type produces a
visible operator message and an explicit decline. This visible fallback is part
of the `openai/form` capability contract.

URL elicitations are shown as literal text with explicit Continue and Decline
choices. OpenClaw does not fetch or open the URL. URLs are limited to 2,048
characters, must use HTTP or HTTPS, cannot include credentials, and cannot
contain control or invisible characters. Invalid URLs produce a visible
explanation and an explicit decline.

Codex `request_user_input` and ordinary MCP elicitations share one per-turn
interactive queue. The Control UI renders each non-secret Gateway question, and
a single choice uses typed channel buttons when the channel supports them.
Button taps, Control UI answers, and the next queued plain-text reply resolve
the same exact app-server request. `serverRequest/resolved` selects a request by
its outer string-or-integer JSON-RPC ID; attempt abort, timeout, and cleanup
cancel the current owner. Late answers cannot resolve a queued replacement.

Only an explicit field `isSecret: true` or Codex question
`isSecret: true` enables secret handling. Secret form fields are requested one
at a time through the warned ephemeral text-reply path and never create durable
Gateway question records. OpenClaw does not infer secrecy from field names.

For the general plugin approval flow that carries these prompts, see
[Plugin permission requests](/plugins/plugin-permission-requests).

## Queue steering

Active-run queue steering maps onto Codex app-server `turn/steer`. With the
default `messages.queue.mode: "steer"`, OpenClaw batches steer-mode chat
messages for the configured quiet window and sends them as one `turn/steer`
request in arrival order.

Inline images and stored attachments keep their original image order. Stored
images use the same hydration, size limits, and filesystem restrictions as a
new turn. If an attachment cannot be prepared or steering is rejected, the
complete message remains queued for a follow-up turn. Preparation and the
`turn/steer` acknowledgment do not count as consumption; a message sent to
Codex without confirmed consumption is not replayed automatically.

When Codex confirms consumption, OpenClaw saves completed visible assistant
items before the steered user message, including items before a tool or sleep
handoff. Each item keeps its own identity so later steers do not duplicate it.
This history prefix is separate from the turn's final-answer selection.

Codex review and manual compaction turns can reject same-turn steering. In
that case, OpenClaw waits for the active run to finish before starting the
prompt. Use `/queue followup` or `/queue collect` when messages should queue
by default instead of steering. See [Steering queue](/concepts/queue-steering).

## Codex feedback upload

When `/diagnostics [note]` is approved for a session on the native Codex
harness, OpenClaw also calls Codex app-server `feedback/upload` for relevant
Codex threads, including logs for each listed thread and spawned Codex
subthreads when available.

The upload goes through Codex's normal feedback path to OpenAI servers. If
Codex feedback is disabled in that app-server, the command returns the
app-server error. The completed diagnostics reply lists the channels,
OpenClaw session ids, Codex thread ids, and local `codex resume <thread-id>`
commands for the threads that were sent.

If you deny or ignore the approval, OpenClaw does not print those Codex ids
and does not send Codex feedback. The upload does not replace the local
Gateway diagnostics export. See [Diagnostics export](/gateway/diagnostics) for
the approval, privacy, local bundle, and group-chat behavior.

Use `/codex diagnostics [note]` only when you want the Codex feedback upload
for the currently attached thread without the full Gateway diagnostics
bundle.

## Compaction and transcript mirror

When the selected model uses the Codex harness, Codex app-server owns native
token-pressure and manual thread compaction. OpenClaw separately owns its
transcript mirror. When `agents.defaults.compaction.maxActiveTranscriptBytes`
is set to a positive value, OpenClaw checks that mirror before ordinary and
heartbeat turns. When the byte guard trips, OpenClaw requires semantic
compaction through its selected host context engine before admitting the turn.
This host compaction does not itself replace or rewrite Codex's canonical
native thread.

After host mirror compaction commits, OpenClaw may request
`thread/compact/start` to synchronize an eligible native thread. This request
is secondary: OpenClaw does not send it for host-isolated operations or
bindings with restricted native authority, and unavailable or failed native
synchronization does not roll back committed host compaction.

Explicit compaction requests, such as `/compact` or a plugin-requested manual
compact operation, start native Codex compaction with `thread/compact/start`.
OpenClaw keeps the request and shared-client lease open until Codex emits the
matching `contextCompaction` completion item and then reports the compaction
turn as completed. If that terminal turn exceeds the configured compaction
timeout, OpenClaw requests a native turn interrupt. The lease and per-thread
compaction fence remain held until Codex reports terminal state or confirms
the interrupt RPC. If Codex does not confirm within the interrupt grace
period, OpenClaw retires the connection before releasing the fence. Remote
connections also detach the matching thread binding so later work cannot
overlap an unconfirmed remote turn. Other turns on a retired connection fail
and can retry on a fresh client. Client closure, request cancellation, or a
failed compaction turn returns a failed operation. Automatic native
token-pressure compaction remains Codex's job. Outside the secondary
synchronization described above, OpenClaw starts native compaction only for
explicit manual requests.

A standalone cold compact operation does not run prompt-build hooks or establish
ordinary-turn configuration. It releases its subscription after the operation;
the next ordinary turn verifies configuration and refreshes generic policy through
the normal resume path. Warm compaction returns only the configuration ownership
it actually acquired.

If context-engine compaction rotates the OpenClaw session generation, the next
Codex turn, compaction, or side question continues the same native thread even if the Gateway stopped
immediately after committing the new generation. Only the recorded predecessor
under that session key can be adopted. Native tool catalogs, connection ownership,
and supervision checks still apply before the resumed thread executes.

When OpenClaw projects an existing session's continuity into a fresh Codex
thread, it includes saved compaction and branch summaries, even when no
earlier user messages remain. Context-engine projections preserve those
summary entries too. Summaries stay quoted as prior context, separate from
the current request, and remain subject to the projection's size limits;
oversized summaries or older context can be truncated. This handoff does not
change native Codex compaction ownership.

When a context engine requests Codex thread-bootstrap projection, OpenClaw
projects tool-call names and ids, input shapes, and redacted tool-result
content into the fresh Codex thread. It does not copy raw tool-call argument
values into that projection.

The mirror includes the user prompt, final assistant text, and lightweight
Codex reasoning records when the app-server emits them. Reasoning retains
typed `thinking` content rather than ordinary final-answer text, so OpenClaw's
existing reasoning visibility and history controls apply. OpenClaw records
the native compaction start and terminal status, but it does not
expose a human-readable compaction summary or an auditable list of which
entries Codex kept after compaction.

Because Codex owns the canonical native thread, `tool_result_persist` does
not rewrite Codex-native tool result records. It only applies when OpenClaw
writes an OpenClaw-owned session transcript tool result.

## Media and delivery

OpenClaw continues to own media delivery and media provider selection. Image,
video, music, PDF, TTS, and media understanding use matching provider/model
settings such as `agents.defaults.mediaModels.image`,
`agents.defaults.mediaModels.video`, `pdfModel`, and `tts`.

Text, images, video, music, TTS, approvals, and messaging-tool output continue
through the normal OpenClaw delivery path; media generation does not require
the legacy runtime. When Codex emits a native image-generation item with a
`savedPath`, OpenClaw forwards that exact file through the normal reply-media
path even if the Codex turn has no assistant text.

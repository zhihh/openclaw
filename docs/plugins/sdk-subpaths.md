title: "Plugin SDK subpaths"
---

The plugin SDK contains narrow public subpaths and repository-only bundled
helpers under `openclaw/plugin-sdk/`. This page catalogs every typed public
subpath and labels selected private-local entries explicitly; it is not an
inventory of every internal runtime helper. Four files define the boundary:

- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entrypoints.json`: the maintained entrypoint inventory
  the build compiles.
- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-private-local-only-subpaths.json`: internal subpaths
  excluded from the typed, documented SDK. Production entries remain available
  as JavaScript-only host runtime exports for separately published official
  plugins; test-only entries stay unexported.
- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-deprecated-public-subpaths.json`: public compatibility
  subpaths retained only through their documented removal windows.
- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entries.mts`: derived public/private export metadata,
  supported bundled facades, and plugin-owned public surfaces.

After changing the entrypoint inventories, run `pnpm plugin-sdk:sync-exports`,
then `pnpm plugin-sdk:check-exports`. The same registration command maintains
package exports, private artifact exclusions in `package.json`'s `files`, and
private workspace declaration aliases in
`extensions/tsconfig.package-boundary.paths.json` and `extensions/xai/tsconfig.json`.
It owns literal flat `!dist/plugin-sdk/<name>.js` and `.d.ts` exclusions, including
names with underscores, uppercase letters, dots, or Unicode, and removes obsolete
exclusions when entries become public or are removed. Nested paths, glob or escape
syntax, non-entrypoint metadata, and other file rules retain their order; unrelated
mappings and XAI's intentional private-alias omissions are preserved.
These local declaration aliases do not add types to JavaScript-only published
SDK exports; test-only entries remain unexported.

Maintainers audit the public export count with `pnpm plugin-sdk:surface` and
the compatibility queue with `pnpm plugins:boundary-report:summary`.

For the plugin authoring guide, see [Plugin SDK overview](/plugins/sdk-overview).

## Plugin entry

Native feature authoring uses `plugin-sdk/feature-contract`
(`defineFeatureContract`, `createFeatureClient`), `plugin-sdk/feature-plugin`
(`defineFeaturePlugin`), and `plugin-sdk/control-ui` (`defineControlUiPlugin`,
host and view types). The contract and Control UI subpaths are browser safe;
`feature-plugin` is backend only. See [Feature plugins](/plugins/feature-plugins).

### Capability catalog entry

A manifest's `capabilityCatalogEntry` default export satisfies
`PluginCapabilityCatalogEntry` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry`:

```ts
import type { PluginCapabilityCatalogEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry";
import { buildSpeechProvider } from "./speech-provider.js";

export default {
  speechProviders: [buildSpeechProvider()],
} satisfies PluginCapabilityCatalogEntry;
```

The optional collections are `speechProviders`, `realtimeTranscriptionProviders`,
and `realtimeVoiceProviders`. Use the same provider factories as full registration;
retain their configuration, aliases, readiness functions, execution methods, and
non-enumerable internal methods. The host registers descriptors through the normal
registrar, preserving its ownership and registration lifecycle.

The export may instead be a synchronous factory receiving
`PluginCapabilityCatalogContext`. It supplies native host operations for readiness,
auth resolution, provider headers, bounded HTTP responses, WebSocket transcription,
and capture/logging. Pass the operations used by a provider into its shared factory;
keep synchronous constructors and invoke the operations only when needed. This
avoids transforming host runtime modules through the plugin source loader during
catalog construction or connection setup. Construction must not query auth stores,
start sessions, or import broad host or plugin runtime modules. Cold discovery does
not receive a live broker; active registrations retain their broker-bound behavior.

See [manifest capability catalogs](/plugins/manifest#capability-catalogs) for family
coverage, compatibility, artifact selection, and failure behavior.

### Compatibility and private-local helpers

Deprecated compatibility subpaths remain exported under their recorded windows
and retention blockers. July 2026 aliases and unused subpaths were deleted,
while bundled-only helpers were excluded from the typed public SDK and are
labeled private-local below. Production-private JavaScript exports remain
available for official plugin runtimes. The maintained list is
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-deprecated-public-subpaths.json`; CI rejects bundled
imports of these compatibility-only subpaths. The broad domain barrels
`plugin-sdk/agent-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/channel-lifecycle`,
`plugin-sdk/conversation-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/hook-runtime`,
`plugin-sdk/media-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/plugin-runtime`, and
`plugin-sdk/security-runtime` are likewise deprecated in favor of focused
subpaths.

OpenClaw's Vitest-backed test-helper subpaths are repo-local only and are no
longer package exports: `agent-runtime-test-contracts`,
`channel-contract-testing`, `channel-target-testing`, `channel-test-helpers`,
`plugin-state-test-runtime`, `plugin-test-api`, `plugin-test-contracts`,
`plugin-test-runtime`, `provider-http-test-mocks`, `provider-test-contracts`,
`reply-payload-testing`, `sqlite-runtime-testing`, `test-env`, `test-fixtures`,
`test-live`, `test-live-auth`, `test-media-generation`,
`test-media-understanding`, `test-node-mocks`, and `testing`.
`ssrf-runtime-internal` is a JavaScript-only host runtime reserved for exact
trusted local-service plugins; it is not a public plugin authoring API.

### Bundled plugin helper subpaths

Bundled-only helper modules are private-local after the July 2026 sweep.
Package contract guardrails classify the supported bundled facades that remain
public until generic contracts replace them. Those facades are deprecated for
new code; see the per-row notes below.

  </Accordion>

The September channel facades remain public as `removal-pending` records until
their recorded blockers are resolved; a registry date does not automatically
remove an export. See the [removal timeline](/plugins/sdk-migration#removal-timeline).
July aliases such as direct-DM access, reply-options, pairing paths, and channel
runtime splinters have been removed; bundled-only helpers are private-local.

  </Accordion>

`createBoundedProviderBinaryStream` requires a request `cleanup` callback.
Stream cancellation and `release()` start source cancellation, unlock the reader,
and run cleanup once, then wait for both operations. Cancellation propagates
source failures; `release()` ignores them. Cleanup failures take precedence in
both cases. Overflow preserves its fitting prefix and error without waiting for
cleanup; later `release()` reports cleanup failure. After EOF or a read error,
the caller must still invoke and await `release()`.

Provider usage snapshots normally report one or more quota `windows`, each with
a label, percent used, and optional reset time. Providers that expose balance or
account-state text instead of resettable quota windows should return
`summary` with an empty `windows` array rather than fabricating percentages.
OpenClaw displays that summary text in status output; use `error` only when the
usage endpoint failed or returned no usable usage data.

  </Accordion>

For structured SecretRefs, `resolveReadOnlyEnvSecretRef` returns `blocked` when the ref cannot be used, including an allowed env ref whose value is missing or empty. Callers may apply their existing fallback only for `missing`; a blocked ref must not borrow ambient or auth-profile credentials. Its provider check follows source-specific default aliases and explicit env allowlists.

Use `isLoopbackHost(host)` when a plugin must accept only the local machine. It accepts `localhost`, IPv4 loopback literals across `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, bracketed IPv6, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback literals. It parses IP literals rather than matching text prefixes, so a DNS name such as `127.0.0.1.evil.com` is not loopback. Use `isPrivateOrLoopbackHost(host)` only when private-network hosts such as RFC 1918 addresses are also valid.

    | `plugin-sdk/agent-harness-task-runtime` | Private-local after July 2026; Generic task lifecycle and completion delivery helpers for harness-backed agents using a host-issued task scope |
    | `plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime` | Agent-harness runtime helpers, including the bounded `agentHarnessStructuredInput` form/URL compilation and execution surface. `acquireSessionWriteLock`, `resolveSessionWriteLockAcquireTimeoutMs`, `resolveSessionWriteLockOptions`, and `SessionWriteLockAcquireTimeoutConfig` are deprecated no-op compatibility exports scheduled for removal in the 2026.10 release train. They no longer block or create lock sidecars; harnesses should rely on OpenClaw's per-session lane plus the durable writer claim and in-transaction fence. |

    | `plugin-sdk/config-contracts` | Focused config surface for plugin config shapes such as `OpenClawConfig` and channel/provider config types, plus the dependency-light runtime helper `resolveGatewayPublicOrigin(cfg)` which returns the normalized `gateway.publicOrigin` (bare http(s) origin, optional reverse-proxy path, no query/hash) or `undefined` when unset, for building links back to the Gateway |
    | `plugin-sdk/config-runtime` | Retained broad config compatibility facade; prefer passed config, `api.pluginConfig`, `config-contracts`, `config-mutation`, and `runtime-config-snapshot` where they cover the needed contract. Named types and private-runtime helpers are not blanket replacements; see [migration guidance](/plugins/sdk-migration#how-to-migrate). |
    | `plugin-sdk/plugin-config-runtime` | Deprecated compatibility facade for runtime plugin-config helpers; new plugins use `api.pluginConfig` plus focused config contracts, snapshots, and mutation helpers |

    | `plugin-sdk/message-tool-delivery-hints` | Private-local after July 2026; Shared message-tool delivery metadata hint strings |

    | `plugin-sdk/reply-runtime` | Shared inbound/reply runtime helpers, chunking, dispatch, heartbeat, reply planner |
    | `plugin-sdk/reply-dispatch-runtime` | Narrow reply dispatch/finalize and conversation-label helpers |
    | `plugin-sdk/reply-history` | Shared short-window reply-history helpers. New message-turn code should use `createChannelHistoryWindow`; lower-level map helpers remain deprecated compatibility exports only |
    | `plugin-sdk/reply-reference` | Private-local after July 2026; `createReplyReferencePlanner` |
    | `plugin-sdk/reply-chunking` | Narrow text/markdown chunking helpers, including `chunkByParagraph` with `splitLongParagraphs: false` for transport-specific final sizing |
    | `plugin-sdk/agent-scope-runtime` | Focused agent ID, directory, default-agent, and session-agent scope resolution helpers for dependency-light control-plane and migration paths. New plugins use `resolveSessionAgentIdsStrict` or `resolveSessionAgentIdStrict` with an explicit or prepared owner. The legacy resolver names preserve ambient system-agent fallback through November 29, 2026; see [Plugin compatibility](/plugins/compatibility#session-agent-resolution-aliases). |
    | `plugin-sdk/session-store-runtime` | Session workflow helpers (`getSessionEntry`, `listSessionEntries`, `patchSessionEntry`, `upsertSessionEntry`), repair/lifecycle helpers (`deleteSessionEntry`, `cleanupSessionLifecycleArtifacts`, `resolveSessionStoreBackupPaths`), marker helpers for transitional `sessionFile` values, bounded recent user/assistant transcript text reads by session identity, session store path/session-key helpers, and updated-at reads, without broad config writes/maintenance imports |

    | `plugin-sdk/sqlite-runtime` | Private-local after July 2026; SQLite agent-schema, path, transaction, and shared-handle borrowing helpers for first-party runtime. Type-only `Generated` and `Selectable` model generated columns and selected rows in Kysely table definitions. `compileSqliteQueryBindings` compiles fixed Kysely SQL with fresh bindings for caller-owned native statements; statement lifetime stays with the caller. `iterateSqliteQuerySync` streams Kysely query rows for incremental decoding; consume the iterator before closing its database. `sqliteStringSet` binds string membership as one SQLite JSON table-valued query parameter, preserving one query snapshot without a variable-count placeholder list. `borrowOpenClawAgentDatabase` returns `{ db, release }`; active borrows prevent cache eviction, `release()` does not close the handle, and explicit owner disposal still revokes it. |
    | `plugin-sdk/cron-store-runtime` | Private-local after July 2026; Cron store path/load/save helpers |
    | `plugin-sdk/state-paths` | State/OAuth dir path helpers |

    | `plugin-sdk/routing` | Route/session-key/account binding helpers such as `resolveAgentRoute`, `buildAgentSessionKey`, and `resolveDefaultAgentBoundAccountId`. Use `normalizeAgentId` when omitted input should resolve to `main`; use the Result-returning `normalizeAgentIdStrict` for an explicitly supplied ID that must not fall back to the default agent. |

    | `plugin-sdk/file-lock` | Private-local after July 2026; Owner-scoped re-entrant file-lock helpers plus Doctor-safe reclaim of definitely stale, unchanged retired lock sidecars.

    Private process callers declare `using prepared = prepareSecretInputStdio(stdio, secretInput)`
    before spawning, then call `await prepared?.deliverTo(child)` once. Delivery closes the writer
    and zeroes the transient credential buffer; disposal closes any untransferred descriptors,
    including when spawning throws. POSIX uses anonymous pipes that support descriptor-path readers
    without credential files; Windows retains its overlapped child pipe. Callers own child cleanup
    when delivery fails.

  <Accordion title="Reserved bundled-helper subpaths">
    Reserved bundled-helper SDK subpaths are narrow owner-specific surfaces for
    bundled plugin code. They are tracked in the SDK inventory so package
    builds and aliasing stay deterministic, but they are not general plugin
    authoring APIs. New reusable host contracts should use generic SDK subpaths
    such as `plugin-sdk/gateway-runtime` and `plugin-sdk/ssrf-runtime`.

    | Subpath | Owner and purpose |
    | --- | --- |
    | `plugin-sdk/codex-mcp-projection` | Private-local after July 2026; Bundled Codex plugin helper for projecting user MCP server config into Codex app-server thread config (default-only package export) |
    | `plugin-sdk/codex-session-transcript-runtime` | Private-local bundled Codex plugin helper for serializing transcript-mirror writes (default-only package export) |
    | `plugin-sdk/ssrf-runtime-internal` | Private-local host helper for configured loopback requests owned by bundled Ollama/browser and the exact official `@openclaw/llama-cpp-provider` package (default-only package export) |

The Control UI covers the common discovery, install, enable, and disable
workflow. The CLI adds update, uninstall, advanced configuration, and explicit
install-source controls. For its full command contract, flags, source-selection
rules, and edge cases, see [`openclaw plugins`](/cli/plugins).

Typical CLI workflow: find a package, install it from ClawHub, npm, git, or a
local path, let the managed Gateway auto-restart (or restart it manually), then
verify the plugin's runtime registrations.

## Use the Control UI

Open **Plugins** in the Control UI, or use `/settings/plugins` relative to the
configured Control UI base path. For example, a base path of `/openclaw` uses
`/openclaw/settings/plugins`. The page has two tabs:

- **Installed** shows the full local inventory grouped by category (channels,
  model providers, memory, tools). Each row opens a detail view; its overflow
  (`…`) menu enables or disables the plugin and, for externally installed
  plugins, offers **Remove**. The tab also lists the configured
  [MCP servers](/cli/mcp) with the same menu-driven enable, disable, and remove
  actions, editing `mcp.servers` in the Gateway configuration.
- **Discover** is the store: featured plugins included with OpenClaw, official
  external plugins, and a curated connector shelf. Connector cards either add a
  hosted MCP server in one click (GitHub, Notion, Linear, Sentry,
  Home Assistant) or jump into a prefilled ClawHub search. Typing in the search
  box queries [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/plugins) inline and appends a **From
  ClawHub** section with download counts and source-verification badges.

Included plugins do not need a package install. Their menu action is **Enable**
or **Disable**. Workboard, for example, is included with OpenClaw and disabled
by default, so choose **Enable** to turn it on. Bundled plugins cannot be
removed, only disabled.

Catalog and search access require `operator.read`. Install, enable, disable,
remove, and MCP server changes require `operator.admin`. A ClawHub install is
performed by the Gateway and preserves its trust, integrity, and plugin-install
policy checks. Enabling an installed plugin as an administrator also records
that explicit trust by adding the selected plugin to an existing restrictive
`plugins.allow` list. An explicit `plugins.deny` entry remains authoritative and
must be removed before enabling the plugin.

Installing, updating, or removing plugin code requires a Gateway restart.
Enablement changes for plugins in the startup inventory can be applied without
a restart when the plugin and current Gateway runtime support it; otherwise
the UI tells you a restart is required.
OAuth-backed MCP connectors still need a one-time `openclaw mcp login <name>`
from the CLI after they are added.

The Control UI does not install from arbitrary npm, git, or local-path sources,
update plugins, or expose rich plugin configuration. Use the CLI workflows
below for those operations.

## List and search plugins

```bash
openclaw plugins list
openclaw plugins list --enabled
openclaw plugins list --verbose
openclaw plugins list --json
openclaw plugins search "calendar"
```

`--json` for scripts:

```bash
openclaw plugins list --json \
  | jq '.plugins[] | {id, enabled, format, source, dependencyStatus}'
```

`plugins list` is a cold inventory check: what OpenClaw can discover from
config, manifests, and the persisted plugin registry. It does not prove an
already-running Gateway imported the plugin runtime. JSON output includes
registry diagnostics and each plugin's `dependencyStatus` (whether declared
`dependencies`/`optionalDependencies` resolve on disk).

`plugins search` queries ClawHub for installable plugin packages and prints
an install hint (`openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>`) per result.

## Enable and disable plugins

```bash
openclaw plugins enable <plugin-id>
openclaw plugins disable <plugin-id>
```

Toggles a plugin's config entry without touching installed files. Some
bundled plugins (bundled model/speech providers, the bundled browser plugin)
are enabled by default; others require `enable` after install.

## Capability consent

OpenClaw asks you to review a third-party plugin's declared capabilities before
installing or enabling it. The consent screen identifies the plugin, its
version and source, artifact integrity, and available trust information. It
also lists declared channels, providers, tools, hooks, MCP servers, CLI
commands and backends, skills, and dangerous configuration flags, along with
the operator grants that apply to hooks, model access, and subagents.

Outside AI onboarding, bundled plugins and verified first-party plugins from OpenClaw's official
catalog do not require this capability review during install, enable, update,
or Doctor repair. For separately installed first-party plugins, OpenClaw checks
the actual package identity against its catalog and verified npm source record
or official-channel record from `https://clawhub.ai`. A matching plugin id or
package name alone is insufficient: local copies, archives, git installs,
custom ClawHub registries, and conflicting source records still require review.
This exemption does not grant OAuth access, operating-system permissions, or
runtime tool approvals, and does not create an operator acceptance record.

AI onboarding also requests a review when you choose an installable provider or
required runtime from the official catalog. After you accept, setup continues
with that provider.

The review token hashes the exact declared capability surface, not the plugin's
executable files. Acceptance separately records installer-provided artifact
integrity when available. Re-enabling an installed plugin reuses acceptance
when its declared surface and recorded integrity are unchanged. Updates of
enabled plugins require fresh consent when the new artifact declares additional
capabilities; unchanged or narrower
surfaces can refresh an existing valid acceptance. Updating a disabled
plugin preserves disablement and defers any required consent until enablement.
Reinstalling through `plugins install` also preserves an authored `enabled: false`,
but requires consent before committing the install when no valid acceptance can
be reused. Run `openclaw plugins enable <plugin-id>` to activate it afterward.

Already-enabled third-party legacy installations remain usable without an initial review;
disabling and re-enabling them requires consent. Setup rechecks consent when
saving its final config, so a plugin update during login cannot activate a
replacement with unaccepted capabilities.

Declining an update's capability review leaves the previous plugin enabled
and unchanged. Repairing a missing or damaged artifact requires a fresh review;
OpenClaw cannot carry acceptance forward from an artifact it cannot verify.

Carrying an earlier acceptance forward requires the install record to pin
artifact integrity, which registry and ClawHub installs provide. Sources
without recorded integrity — notably local paths — cannot prove the new bytes
are the artifact you approved before, so they ask for consent on every install
rather than inheriting it.

Interactive CLI commands, onboarding, and provider, search, or channel setup
prompt when consent is required, including automatic installs of required
runtime plugins. Noninteractive or silent setup cannot approve new capabilities.
Review and preinstall or enable the plugin with `--accept-capabilities`, then
retry setup. Noninteractive plugin install, update, and enable commands also
require the explicit flag when consent is needed:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package> --accept-capabilities
openclaw plugins update <plugin-id> --accept-capabilities
openclaw plugins enable <plugin-id> --accept-capabilities
```

Doctor uses the same source checks and review before installing or adopting a replacement plugin.
`doctor --fix` and `--yes` do not approve capabilities automatically. For
noninteractive repair, review and install the plugin with the explicit flag
above, then rerun doctor.

Chat installs and enablement use the same capability consent. When consent is
required, review the capabilities in the reply, then rerun the same command
with `--accept-capabilities`:

```text
/plugins install clawhub:<package> --accept-capabilities
/plugins install npm:<package> --force --accept-capabilities
/plugins enable <plugin-id> --accept-capabilities
```

Plugins discovered directly
in a workspace or through `plugins.load.paths`, without a managed install
record, cannot persist capability acceptance. Their details in the Control UI
still show declared capabilities.

`openclaw plugins install --link <path>` creates a managed install record and
requires capability consent even though it loads the plugin from its source
directory. It is not the same as adding a bare `plugins.load.paths` entry.

## Install plugins

```bash
# Search ClawHub for plugin packages.
openclaw plugins search "calendar"

# Install from ClawHub.
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>@1.2.3
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>@beta

# Install from npm.
openclaw plugins install npm:<package>
openclaw plugins install npm:@scope/openclaw-plugin@1.2.3
openclaw plugins install npm:@openclaw/codex

# Install from a local npm-pack artifact.
openclaw plugins install npm-pack:<path.tgz>

# Install from git or a local development checkout.
openclaw plugins install git:github.com/acme/openclaw-plugin@v1.0.0
openclaw plugins install ./my-plugin
openclaw plugins install --link ./my-plugin
```

Bare package specs install from npm during the launch cutover, unless the
name matches a bundled or official plugin id, in which case OpenClaw uses
that local/official copy instead. Use `clawhub:`, `npm:`, `git:`, or
`npm-pack:` for deterministic source selection. OpenClaw's bundled and official
catalog packages are trusted alongside ClawHub packages. New arbitrary npm,
git, local path/archive, `npm-pack:`, or marketplace sources require
`--force` in noninteractive installs after you review
and trust the source.

`--force` confirms a non-ClawHub source without prompting and overwrites an
existing install target when needed. For routine upgrades of a tracked npm,
ClawHub, or hook-pack install, use `openclaw plugins update` instead. With
`--link`, `--force` only confirms the source; the linked directory is not
copied or overwritten.

If a newly installed plugin requires configuration that is not present yet,
OpenClaw records the install but leaves the plugin disabled. Configure
`plugins.entries.<id>.config`, then run `openclaw plugins enable <id>`. If an
existing config entry is present but invalid, install fails without rewriting it.

A plugin package can expose multiple child entries. Installation tracks that
package once, enables each ready child entry, and preserves any child that you
explicitly disabled. Runtime policy remains child-addressable through
`plugins.entries.<child-id>`, allow/deny lists, channel config, exact child load
paths, and the `memory` and `contextEngine` slots.

## Restart and inspect

A running managed Gateway with config reload enabled restarts automatically
after installing, updating, or uninstalling plugin code. If the Gateway is
unmanaged or reload is disabled, restart it yourself before checking live
runtime surfaces:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw plugins inspect <plugin-id> --runtime --json
```

The Gateway keeps the plugin inventory it discovered at startup. Management
commands can inspect a newly installed package before restart, but that does
not make its code or metadata available to the running Gateway. Manifest edits
and plugins added to an agent workspace also require a restart. Ordinary config,
enablement, and account changes can still hot-apply against the existing
inventory.

For API clients, `plugins.refresh` reports `restartRequired: true` and requests
a restart through config reload. With `gateway.reload.mode: "off"`, restart
manually; refresh does not rescan or replace the running inventory.

`inspect --runtime` loads the plugin module and proves it registered runtime
surfaces (tools, hooks, services, Gateway methods, HTTP routes, plugin-owned
CLI commands). Plain `inspect` and `list` are cold manifest/config/registry
checks only.

## Update plugins

```bash
openclaw plugins update <plugin-id>
openclaw plugins update <npm-package-or-spec>
openclaw plugins update --all
openclaw plugins update <plugin-id> --dry-run
```

Passing a plugin id reuses its tracked install spec: stored dist-tags
(`@beta`) and exact pinned versions carry over to later `update <plugin-id>`
runs. For a multi-entry package, any child id resolves to the one tracked
package install, so all siblings update together. Removed or renamed children
have their stale entries, allow/deny policy, exact load paths, channel config,
and memory/context slot selections reconciled before the new package/index
state commits; retained/new children and unrelated plugins are preserved.

If OpenClaw cannot prove exactly one package owner and a complete child list,
update and uninstall fail closed without changing package files, config, or the
installed index. Run `openclaw plugins registry --refresh`, inspect
`openclaw plugins doctor`, and use `openclaw doctor --fix` for repairable legacy
index state. If the ambiguity remains, reinstall the package before retrying.

`openclaw plugins update --all` is the bulk maintenance path. It still
respects ordinary tracked install specs, but trusted official OpenClaw
plugin records sync to the current official catalog target instead of
staying pinned to a stale exact official package. The canonical channel
resolver uses both `update.channel` and the installed core version, so an
installed beta core with no configured channel keeps official plugins on the
beta release line. Use a targeted `update <plugin-id>` to keep an exact or
tagged official spec untouched.

For npm installs, pass an explicit package spec to switch the tracked
record:

```bash
openclaw plugins update @scope/openclaw-plugin@beta
openclaw plugins update @scope/openclaw-plugin
```

The second command moves a plugin back to the registry's default release
line when it was previously pinned to an exact version or tag.

See [`openclaw plugins`](/cli/plugins#update) for the exact fallback and
pinning rules.

## Uninstall plugins

```bash
openclaw plugins uninstall <plugin-id> --dry-run
openclaw plugins uninstall <plugin-id>
openclaw plugins uninstall <plugin-id> --keep-files
```

Uninstall removes the package's persisted install record and every owned child's
settings from plugin config, allow/deny lists, memory/context slots, exact linked
`plugins.load.paths`, and channel config entries when applicable. It retains only
an exact `enabled: false` marker for each removed child so remaining model,
provider, or channel selections cannot automatically reinstall the package during
startup repair. Reinstalling does not silently re-enable it; enabling the plugin
again replaces the marker. You may address a multi-entry package by any child id;
the preview names the package owner and all siblings that will be removed. The
managed install directory is removed once unless you pass `--keep-files`. A
running managed Gateway restarts automatically when the uninstall changes plugin
source.

If an installed Claw references the plugin, preview and uninstall print the
affected Claw package names. Ordinary plugin uninstall can still proceed and
may break those Claws; use `openclaw claws status` to review ownership first.
Removing a Claw releases its plugin reference but retains the process-wide
plugin by default.

In Nix mode (`OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`), plugin install, update, uninstall,
enable, and disable are all disabled; manage those choices in the Nix source
for the install instead.

## Choose a source

| Source      | Use when                                                                    | Example                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ClawHub     | You want OpenClaw-native discovery, scan summaries, versions, and hints     | `openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>`                   |
| git         | You want a branch, tag, or commit from a repository                         | `openclaw plugins install git:github.com/<owner>/<repo>@<ref>` |
| local path  | You are developing or testing a plugin on the same machine                  | `openclaw plugins install --link ./my-plugin`                  |
| marketplace | You are installing a Claude-compatible marketplace plugin                   | `openclaw plugins install <plugin> --marketplace <source>`     |
| npm pack    | You are proving a local package artifact through npm install semantics      | `openclaw plugins install npm-pack:<path.tgz>`                 |
| npmjs.com   | You already ship JavaScript packages or need npm dist-tags/private registry | `openclaw plugins install npm:@acme/openclaw-plugin`           |

Managed local path installs must be plugin directories or archives. Put
standalone plugin files in `plugins.load.paths` instead of installing them
with `plugins install`.

## Publish plugins

ClawHub is the primary public discovery surface for OpenClaw plugins. Publish
there when you want users to find plugin metadata, version history, registry
scan results, and install hints before they install.

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
clawhub login
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin@v1.0.0
```

Native npm plugins must ship a plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`) plus
`package.json` metadata before publishing:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "@acme/openclaw-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./dist/index.js"]
  }
}
```

```bash
npm publish --access public
openclaw plugins install npm:@acme/openclaw-plugin
openclaw plugins install npm:@acme/openclaw-plugin@beta
openclaw plugins install npm:@acme/openclaw-plugin@1.0.0
```

Use these pages for the full publishing contract instead of treating this
page as the publishing reference:

- [ClawHub publishing](/clawhub/publishing) explains owners, scopes,
  releases, review, package validation, and package transfer.
- [Building plugins](/plugins/building-plugins) shows the full plugin
  package shape (including `openclaw.plugin.json`) and first publish
  workflow.
- [Plugin manifest](/plugins/manifest) defines native plugin manifest
  fields.

If the same package is available on both ClawHub and npm, use the explicit
`clawhub:` or `npm:` prefix to force one source.

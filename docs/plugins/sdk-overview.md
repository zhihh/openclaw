The plugin SDK is the typed contract between plugins and core. This page is the
reference for **what to import** and **what you can register**.

<Note>
  This page is for plugin authors using `openclaw/plugin-sdk/*` inside
  OpenClaw. For external apps, scripts, dashboards, CI jobs, and IDE extensions
  that want to run agents through the Gateway, use
  [Gateway integrations for external apps](/gateway/external-apps) instead.
</Note>

<Tip>
Looking for a how-to guide instead? Start with [Building plugins](/plugins/building-plugins). Use [Channel plugins](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins) for channels, [Provider plugins](/plugins/sdk-provider-plugins) for model providers, [CLI backend plugins](/plugins/cli-backend-plugins) for local AI CLI backends, [Agent harness plugins](/plugins/sdk-agent-harness) for native agent executors, and [Plugin hooks](/plugins/hooks) for tool or lifecycle hooks.
</Tip>

## API stability

All OpenClaw plugin APIs are **experimental**. This includes every
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/*` subpath, registration and runtime APIs, channel and
provider contracts, hooks, and native Control UI APIs. These contracts can
change between OpenClaw releases.

Pin the OpenClaw version used to develop and deploy your plugin, and test each
host version you declare compatible. Set package compatibility ranges from
those tested versions; do not assume a working build supports future releases.
Existing [compatibility windows and upgrade migrations](/plugins/compatibility)
still apply. Experimental status does not remove a documented migration path.

Native UI from user-installed plugins also requires the default-off
[Custom plugin UI lab](/plugins/feature-plugins#enable-custom-plugin-ui).
Backend plugin APIs and ordinary plugin loading do not require that setting.

## Import convention

For features with native Control UI, use [Feature plugins](/plugins/feature-plugins):
`feature-contract` defines shared operations, `feature-plugin` registers their
backend implementations, and `control-ui` exposes browser contribution and
replacement contracts.

Always import from a specific subpath:

```typescript
import { definePluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry";
import { defineChannelPluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core";
```

Each subpath is a small, self-contained module. This keeps startup fast and
prevents circular dependency issues. For channel-specific entry/build helpers,
prefer `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core`; keep `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` for
the broader umbrella surface and shared helpers such as
`buildChannelConfigSchema`.

For channel config, publish the channel-owned JSON Schema through
`openclaw.plugin.json#channelConfigs`. The `plugin-sdk/channel-config-schema`
subpath is for shared schema primitives and the generic builder. OpenClaw's
bundled plugins use `plugin-sdk/bundled-channel-config-schema` for retained
bundled-channel schemas. That bundled schema subpath is not a pattern for new
plugins.

<Warning>
  Do not import provider- or channel-branded convenience seams (for example
  `openclaw/plugin-sdk/slack`, `.../discord`, `.../signal`, `.../whatsapp`).
  Bundled plugins compose generic SDK subpaths inside their own `api.ts` /
  `runtime-api.ts` barrels; core consumers should either use those plugin-local
  barrels or add a narrow generic SDK contract when a need is truly
  cross-channel.

A small set of bundled-plugin helper seams still appear in the generated export
map when they have tracked owner usage. They exist for bundled-plugin
maintenance only and are not recommended import paths for new third-party
plugins.

`openclaw/plugin-sdk/discord` and `openclaw/plugin-sdk/telegram-account` are
also kept as deprecated compatibility facades for tracked owner usage. Do not
copy those import paths into new plugins; use injected runtime helpers and
generic channel SDK subpaths instead.
</Warning>

## Subpath reference

The plugin SDK is exposed as a set of narrow subpaths grouped by area (plugin
entry, channel, provider, auth, runtime, capability, memory, and reserved
bundled-plugin helpers). For the full catalog — grouped and linked — see
[Plugin SDK subpaths](/plugins/sdk-subpaths).

The compiler entrypoint inventory lives in
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entrypoints.json`; typed public exports exclude the
internal subpaths listed in
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-private-local-only-subpaths.json`. Production entries
on that list retain JavaScript-only host runtime exports for separately
published official plugins, while test-only entries remain unexported. Run
`pnpm plugin-sdk:surface` to audit the public export count. Deprecated public
subpaths that are old enough and unused by bundled extension production code are
tracked in `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-deprecated-public-subpaths.json`; broad
deprecated re-export barrels are tracked in
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-deprecated-barrel-subpaths.json`.

## Registration API

The `register(api)` callback receives an `OpenClawPluginApi` object with these
methods:

Plugins that provide an external team-chat surface for a session can register
the single process-wide provider exported by
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-discussion`. Its `info({ sessionKey })` method
reports whether a discussion is unavailable, ready to open, or already open;
`open({ sessionKey })` creates or resolves the discussion and returns its embed
and external URLs. Registering another provider replaces the current provider.

Transcript source providers that share an account namespace with an inbound
channel declare an `accountOwnership` descriptor with that channel id and a
canonical account resolver. OpenClaw then
ignores model-selected account ids for same-channel capture, binds the trusted
inbound account, and records it as the session owner for later lifecycle
actions. The resolver also selects an omitted account before OpenClaw starts or
persists live capture. It validates an already-bound trusted account without
redirecting it and returns an actionable typed error when no unique capable
account exists. Configured auto-start must supply a nonempty source account or
resolve one with this descriptor. OpenClaw rejects ambiguous or unresolved ownership before it
persists the start or invokes the provider. Provider aliases are lookup names
only and must not be used for this declaration.

Worker providers must also declare their id in `contracts.workerProviders`.
Providers may implement `maintain({ profiles, signal, assertCurrent })` for bounded cleanup that must continue with no active leases. The Gateway invokes it for enabled, configured providers from its existing periodic worker sweep, separately from allocation and reconciliation waits. `profiles` contains cloned settings for the provider's current configured profiles. Call `assertCurrent()` immediately before external effects and after awaited work before durable mutations; authority ends when the invocation settles, its configuration or registration changes, or the Gateway stops. Honor `signal` and settle only after owned commands stop. A provider's plugin service must also cancel and drain maintenance during generation replacement. The hook must not allocate running capacity or treat maintenance as user demand; retention and cleanup policy remain provider-owned.

Core persists durable intent before `provision(profile, operationId, options?)`. Providers validate settings and any optional `options.machineClass` and `options.executionMode` before external allocation and throw `WorkerProviderError` for permanent profile rejection. `provision` must adopt the same lease for the same operation id and selected execution mode; a retry cannot silently change modes. If provider-owned setup fails after allocation and cleanup is indeterminate, throw `WorkerProviderError.cleanupIndeterminate(leaseId, provisionError, cleanupError)` so core persists the known lease and reconciles teardown instead of replaying provision. Providers may expose process-stable picker metadata with asynchronous `listMachineOptions(profile)`; omit the hook when the profile has no meaningful machine choice. Machine options contain only `id`, `label`, optional positive-integer `cpu` and `memoryGb`, and optional `default`. Session-placement providers declare one or both current `supportedExecutionModes` values in deterministic canonical order: `["worker-turn"]`, `["remote-exec"]`, or `["worker-turn", "remote-exec"]`. Empty lists, duplicate values, unknown modes, and noncanonical order are rejected. `worker-turn` requires a node lease; `remote-exec` accepts either a node lease or an existing SSH lease. Omission advertises no placement modes while preserving direct environment lifecycle calls. Direct environment creation without a session supplies no execution mode, so providers retain their intentional default setup; the bundled Crabbox provider defaults to `worker-turn`. Providers whose provisioning can legitimately exceed core's five-minute default may return a positive millisecond budget from `resolveProvisionTimeoutMs(profile)`; include acquisition, provider-owned setup, and cleanup in that bound. `resolveDestroyTimeoutMs(profile)` declares the equivalent budget for teardown, including snapshot capture or other provider-owned work before confirmed release. Core uses that budget for both requested teardown and bootstrap-failure cleanup; an explicit service timeout override takes precedence. Budgets must be positive safe integers within the platform timer limit.
An optional `options.signal` cancels the current provisioning attempt. Forward it to acquisition, project preparation, setup, readiness, and enrollment waits, and settle active commands before rejecting; a caller-visible timeout or abort is not proof that a provider child exited or a lease was released. Compose it with project, runtime-preparation, and enrollment signals instead of replacing it with a narrower grant's signal. Keep cleanup on its independent, uncancelled lifecycle authority. Core records destroy intent for the exact operation and resolves its allocation before canonical teardown; providers that cannot cancel promptly remain owned until their real operation settles. Gateway shutdown is distinct: enrollment closure alone retains a fixed allocation for restart adoption, while an aborted provisioning signal means explicit cancellation.

Every worker provider must implement `resolveAllocation(profile, operationId)`, returning `{ leaseId: string; sharedHost: boolean }` for the exact operation. Core passes the frozen settings snapshot, even after the named profile changes or is removed. The handle identifies the cleanup target; it does not prove a machine was created or a transport is ready. Resolution must not allocate, start, renew, run setup, read setup secrets, enroll nodes, or wait for availability. Throw if the identity cannot be resolved safely. When destruction is requested before a provision result is recorded, core persists this handle with the existing teardown state and calls `destroy`, without replaying `provision`. `destroy` still must prove release or authoritative absence. Both calls remain serialized behind any earlier provider operation until it actually settles, including after a caller-visible timeout.

Providers that enroll cloud nodes set `requiresNodeEnrollment: true` and call `options.beginNodeEnrollment()` after allocating the machine. The returned `WorkerNodeEnrollment` supplies `displayName`, `openclawVersion`, an optional enrollment-lifetime `signal`, `waitForDeviceId()`, and either `mode: "connect"` with `setupCode` and `setupId`, or `mode: "resume"` with the bound `deviceId`. Its required `nodeBootstrap` contains the Gateway-prepared runtime archive's `url`, secret bearer `token`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `openclawVersion`, `enabledPluginIds`, and optional `tlsFingerprint`. Download that exact archive, verify its size and digest, install its target-platform dependencies, and enable the listed plugins in the node's isolated state before connecting. Do not substitute a global or registry package based only on a matching version. Keep download and enrollment credentials out of command arguments, logs, npm, and the launched node's environment; cancel work when `signal` aborts. Download authority belongs to the live enrollment attempt, not the URL or digest alone. After connection, return the device identity from `waitForDeviceId()` in the node lease. See [Bundle installation](/gateway/cloud-workers#bundle-installation) for source builds, artifact reuse, and proxy requirements. Bootstrap installation does not authorize node commands or replace invocation policy.

Providers that capture reusable project images can declare `supportsProjectPreparation(profile, machineClass)`. For eligible Git placements, core persists a project identity and pinned base commit before allocation, then supplies `options.project`. Call its `prepare({ runScript, upload })` adapter on the allocated machine; core owns the bounded Git pack, clean checkout verification, and cache layout, while the provider owns command and file transport. Honor `project.signal` and call `project.assertCurrent()` around awaited provider work. Retained callbacks reject after the provision attempt closes. Project keys are scoped to the Gateway and repository, including linked worktrees; session edits and Git credentials are excluded from the prepared base.

Before capturing, call `options.prepareNodeRuntime()` to obtain artifact access without creating a node identity or enrollment code. The result includes `nodeBootstrap`, `workerBundle`, and the operation's cancellation `signal`. The worker archive descriptor supplies `url`, secret `token`, `sha256`, `bytes`, optional `tlsFingerprint`, and the core-owned `packageRelativePath` within the installed node package. Download and verify both archives, install the runtime, and publish the compressed worker archive at that exact contained location before capture. Keep one published worker archive per runtime package, exclude credentials and receipts, and never add the standalone payload to the slim runtime archive. The normal authenticated installer validates the prepared bytes and creates a fresh installation after enrollment; the raw archive grants no admission authority. Finish capture before calling `beginNodeEnrollment()`. Beginning enrollment, cancellation, replacement, or closure revokes both preparation grants. A native capture with an uncertain outcome must settle or be explicitly recovered before enrollment can introduce credentials into its source machine. Persist the original cold/checkpoint allocation decision before contacting the provider, retain checkpoint references until confirmed release, and never switch images when replaying the same operation.

Core persists the validated profile settings with the lease and supplies that snapshot to `destroy({ leaseId, profile })`, which must be idempotent, and `inspect({ leaseId, profile })`, which returns `active`, `dormant`, `destroyed`, or `unknown`. This lets providers route lifecycle calls after a gateway restart or named-profile removal. SSH endpoints use a `SecretRef` for `keyRef`, never inline key material, and include a `hostKey` from trusted provisioning output as exactly `algorithm base64`, without a hostname or comment. Core pins `hostKey` and never trusts a key from the first connection. Providers may also return up to 10 ordered, unique `fallbackPorts` (integer ports from 1 through 65535, excluding the primary `port`); core validates and persists those advertised candidates for idempotent probes, content-addressed transfers, receipt/lock-guarded artifact installation, convergent managed-worktree mirroring, and tunnel reconnects. Ambiguous unguarded stateful commands fail closed and are not replayed across candidates. A lease may set `sharedHost: true` when the SSH account also owns unrelated processes; core then avoids host-wide process freezing during workspace reconciliation. Omitted or `false` means a dedicated worker host. Active inspection repeats this fact so core can reconcile provider-owned isolation for leases persisted before the field existed; tunnel startup waits for that first authoritative inspection. A provider that mints a dynamic `keyRef` can implement `resolveSshIdentity({ leaseId, profile, keyRef })`; when present, that resolver is authoritative, while providers without it use the configured generic secret resolver.
`WorkerLease.desktop` is optional and has the shape `{ protocol: "rfb"; port: number; passwordFilePath?: string; apps?: WorkerDesktopApp[] }`; `passwordFilePath`, when present, must be absolute. Providers report this warm-time capability from `provision`; it cannot be retrofitted onto a live lease. The owning SSH or node carrier reads the password on the worker when needed and never persists it in the Gateway store. `WorkerDesktopApp` is a closed union: `{ id: "browser"; executablePath: string; cdpPort: number }` or `{ id: "terminal"; executablePath: string }`. App ids must be unique, executable paths must be absolute, browser CDP ports must be integers from 1 through 65535, and the list accepts at most eight entries. Core rejects unknown ids and fields.
Providers with renewable leases can also implement `renew(leaseId)`.
`inspect` must throw on transient or indeterminate failures; return `unknown` only for authoritative absence. Core fences the environment and invokes canonical teardown; shared or unknown host isolation still requires acknowledgment that the exact worker stopped. A shared host must not be stopped or unpaired merely to release its logical lease.

Embedding providers registered with `api.registerEmbeddingProvider(...)` must
also be listed in `contracts.embeddingProviders` in the plugin manifest. This
is the generic embedding surface for reusable vector generation. Memory search
consumes this generic provider surface. The older memory-specific registrar and
manifest contract were removed after their August 2026 migration window.

Memory-specific providers that still expose a runtime `batchEmbed(...)` stay on
the existing per-file batching contract unless their runtime explicitly sets
`sourceWideBatchEmbed: true`. That opt-in lets the memory host submit chunks from
multiple dirty memory files and enabled sources in one `batchEmbed(...)` call up
to the host batch limits. Batch adapters that upload JSONL request files must
split provider jobs before their upload-size cap as well as their request-count
cap. The provider must return one embedding per input chunk in the same order as
`batch.chunks`; omit the flag when the provider expects file-local batches or
cannot preserve input ordering across a larger source-wide job.

### Tools and commands

Use [`defineToolPlugin`](/plugins/tool-plugins) for simple tool-only plugins
with fixed tool names. Use `api.registerTool(...)` directly for mixed plugins
or fully dynamic tool registration.

| Method                                   | What it registers                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api.registerTool(tool, opts?)`          | Agent tool (required or `{ optional: true }`)                                                                                            |
| `api.registerCommand(def)`               | Custom command (bypasses the LLM)                                                                                                        |
| `api.registerNodeHostCommand(command)`   | Command handled by `openclaw node run`; optional `agentTool` metadata can expose it as an agent-visible tool while the node is connected |
| `api.registerWidgetPresenter(presenter)` | Explicit or current-channel destination behind the core `show_widget` tool                                                               |

Explicit widget presenters declare a unique model-visible target such as `node_panel`. Current-channel presenters use `target: "current_channel"`, provide a synchronous `match(context)` predicate over trusted delivery facts, and declare supported source kinds and delivery limits. Multiple transport presenters may coexist, but core selects an implicit route only when exactly one matches.

Core validates the canonical `show_widget` schema, composes the bounded HTML document, and passes immutable HTML plus an optional hosted URL to `present(...)`. Presenters return either a generic message receipt or a node receipt. Expected availability and presentation failures use the closed error result instead of throwing; core falls back inline only for an actual `inline-widgets` client and otherwise surfaces the failure.

Computer Use providers use `registerComputerUseProvider(api, provider)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/computer-use`. It registers the shared
`screen.snapshot`/`computer.act` node-host envelope once while the provider
keeps its driver, frame, availability, and execution lifecycle local.
Its optional `prepare(context)` hook settles native startup before the node's
first capability declaration, without opening a Computer Use execution.

Plugin commands can set `agentPromptGuidance` when the agent needs a short,
command-owned routing hint. Keep that text about the command itself; do not add
provider- or plugin-specific policy to core prompt builders.

Commands may also declare a bounded client presentation action for parsed no-argument
invocations:

```ts
clientPresentation: {
  when: "no-arguments",
  action: { kind: "device-pairing" },
}
```

The action union is closed and intentionally does not accept routes, callbacks,
URLs, or arbitrary client data. Supporting clients handle the action only when
they can complete it; otherwise the command follows its normal remote path.
This metadata expresses presentation intent, not authorization: the Gateway
remains authoritative for every RPC the client flow performs.

Guidance entries may be legacy strings, which apply to every prompt surface, or
structured entries:

```ts
agentPromptGuidance: [
  "Global command hint.",
  { text: "Only show this in the main OpenClaw prompt.", surfaces: ["openclaw_main"] },
];
```

Structured `surfaces` may include `openclaw_main`, `codex_app_server`,
`cli_backend`, `acp_backend`, or `subagent`. `pi_main` remains a deprecated alias
for `openclaw_main`. Omit `surfaces` for intentional all-surface guidance. Do
not pass an empty `surfaces` array; it is rejected so accidental scope loss does
not become global prompt text.

Native Codex app-server developer instructions are stricter than other prompt
surfaces: only guidance explicitly scoped to `codex_app_server` is promoted into
that higher-priority lane. Legacy string guidance and unscoped structured
guidance remain available to non-Codex prompt surfaces for compatibility.

Node-host commands run on the connected node host, not inside the Gateway
process. If `agentTool` is present, the node publishes a descriptor after a
successful Gateway connect; the Gateway exposes it to agent runs only while that
node is connected and only if the descriptor's `command` is in the node's
approved command surface. Set `agentTool.defaultPlatforms` to opt a
non-dangerous command into the default node command allowlist; otherwise require
explicit `gateway.nodes.commands.allow` or a node-invoke policy. `agentTool.name`
must be provider-safe: start with a letter, use only letters, digits,
underscores, or hyphens, and stay within 64 characters. MCP-backed node tools
can set `agentTool.mcp` metadata so catalog and tool-search surfaces can show
the remote MCP server/tool identity, but execution still goes through the
advertised node command.

Gateway methods default to `profileAccess: "required"`, so authenticated-profile verification fails closed before plugin dispatch. Set `profileAccess: "independent"` only for an audited method that neither reads nor mutates durable user or session state. Operator scope remains a separate authorization requirement.

#### File-watch capacity errors

`getFileWatchCapacityCode(error)` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/file-access-runtime`
returns `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`, or `ENOSPC` for a native watch failure, or `undefined`
for other errors. It requires `syscall: "watch"` because watcher libraries can
forward directory-scan errors through the same error event. Use the result in
the watcher lifecycle owner to stop native retries and select an existing
refresh path.

#### SQLite write admission

`runSqliteImmediateTransaction(db, prepare, options?)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/sqlite-runtime` waits for write admission without blocking
the event loop. Its asynchronous `prepare` function may run more than once when
another writer holds the database. Keep preparation repeatable: read and plan
there, then return a **synchronous** transaction callback. Revalidate current
owner and row predicates inside that callback before writing.

Returning `undefined` from preparation skips the write and resolves the helper
to `undefined`, even while another writer remains active. Otherwise, the helper
resolves to the transaction callback's result. It rejects an already active
transaction or preparation that leaves a transaction open. Once admitted, the
callback runs once; callback and commit failures are never replayed.

Admission retries use the connection's existing `busy_timeout`; this is not a
total deadline for preparation or transaction execution. `options` supplies the
same transaction diagnostics as `runSqliteImmediateTransactionSync`. Keep the
database handle and its owning operation alive until the returned promise settles.

#### Webhook body rejection

Use `readWebhookBodyOrReject` or `readJsonWebhookBodyOrReject` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/webhook-request-guards` for bounded body reads. Return when
the result is `{ ok: false }`; the helper owns the error response and connection
cleanup. Body byte limits and read timeouts remain separate from transport cleanup.

For a custom error representation after a response-first body read, await
`sendHttpRequestRejection(req, res, statusCode, body, contentType?)` instead of
calling `res.end()` and destroying the request. It preserves security headers,
frames the complete error, then on Node closes the write side while keeping application
body readers paused. Node's request backpressure bounds residual input buffering;
cleanup allows at most one second, not another body-read timeout. A disconnected peer, malformed HTTP, or an
exhausted cleanup budget can prevent delivery. Committed responses are closed
without appending a replacement error or completing a partial successful body.

On Node, transport-owned rejections emit response `close` without `finish`.
Use `close` for terminal cleanup or selected-error diagnostics; it does not prove
delivery. Keep successful-response activity on `finish`, with the caller's
success-status check, so an aborted request cannot report healthy activity.

Bun uses its native HTTP response completion because its raw socket operations
do not flush the HTTP response. Bun can still report client connection resets
during large outstanding uploads, even after delivering the complete error.

Gateway HTTP requests run in order on each connection, including their response
lifetimes. A closing connection cannot admit later requests or upgrades. Queued
requests apply input backpressure until earlier responses finish; finite pipelines
drain in order. Use separate connections for concurrent requests. Keep the release hook returned by
`beginWebhookRequestPipelineOrReject` in `finally`; it retains any selected
rejection cleanup before releasing the in-flight slot.

#### Post-ack webhook work

Webhook routes that acknowledge a request before processing finishes must move
that detached work onto its own tracked admission root:

```typescript
import { runDetachedWebhookWork } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/webhook-request-guards";

void runDetachedWebhookWork(() => processWebhookEvent(event)).catch((error) => {
  runtime.error?.(`webhook dispatch failed: ${String(error)}`);
});
```

Call `runDetachedWebhookWork(...)` synchronously while the HTTP request is still
admitted. The helper reserves an independent root immediately, then starts the
callback in the next microtask so the request handler can write its
acknowledgement first. The returned promise adopts the callback result; callers
still own rejection handling. This keeps post-ack queue work accepted and makes
restart or suspension drains wait for it. Handlers that await all processing
before returning do not need this helper.

#### Requester-scoped MCP connections

Keep the MCP server **identity** static (name, tool filter) in `mcp.servers`, a
native plugin's `mcpServers` manifest field, or a bundle manifest. Optionally register a connection resolver so each trusted
message requester gets their own transport:

```ts
api.registerMcpServerConnectionResolver({
  serverName: "user-email",
  resolve: async (ctx) => {
    // ctx.requesterSenderId is host-trusted; never invent sender identity here.
    const token = await lookupUserToken(ctx.requesterSenderId);
    if (!token) {
      return null; // omit this server for the current run
    }
    return {
      url: "https://mcp.example.com/email",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    };
  },
});
```

Contract notes:

- Resolver context carries trusted host identity only (`requesterSenderId`,
  optional `agentAccountId` / `messageChannel`). Future trusted fields (for
  example cron/subagent user context) can be added additively.
- One plugin owns one server name: a duplicate
  `registerMcpServerConnectionResolver` for the same `serverName` from another
  plugin is rejected with an error diagnostic (first registration wins), so
  connection ownership never depends on plugin load order.
- Tool names are derived from the full declared server set so partial resolution
  never changes safe server names between requesters or turns. Core does not
  verify that different requester endpoints serve identical tool schemas; a
  resolver must point every requester at the same logical service, or tool
  schemas (and prompt-cache stability) diverge per requester.
- Runs without a trusted `requesterSenderId` (cron, subagent, heartbeat, public
  gateway) never materialize requester-scoped servers. There is no shared
  fallback connection.
- `resolve` is bounded at 10 seconds per server; a timeout or throw omits that
  server for the run without failing static MCP.
- Resolved connections are revalidated at most every 5 minutes per requester:
  rotation rebuilds the transport with fresh credentials, and a `null` result
  revokes it (the cached runtime is disposed even mid-session). A revoked or
  rotated credential can therefore stay in use for up to 5 minutes.
- Resolved `headers` are never logged or persisted; core keeps only an ephemeral
  in-memory keyed digest (process-local HMAC) to detect credential rotation, and
  registers resolved header/URL credential values with the log/debug-capture
  redaction registry.
- Requester-scoped servers do not mint MCP App views: a view outlives the
  requester-authenticated run and the gateway view boundary has no requester
  identity, so app previews stay fail-closed for these servers. Tool results
  are unaffected.
- Static servers without a resolver keep the existing session-scoped lifecycle.
- **Harness delivery rule:** requester-scoped servers never enter harness-native
  MCP client config (Codex thread `mcp_servers`, CLI `-c mcp_servers=…`, or any
  other session-shared MCP projection). Harnesses deliver them as run-scoped
  tools instead:
  - Embedded runner: session MCP runtime + bundle tools (static + scoped).
  - Codex app-server: dynamic tools via
    `materializeRequesterScopedMcpToolsForHarnessRun` (scoped-only; static
    servers stay on Codex's native MCP client).
- Scoped tool **specs** are session-stable after the first successful resolve in
  that session, so shared-thread harnesses (Codex) do not rotate threads when
  senders change. Before any requester resolves, no scoped specs are advertised.
- Unauthenticated requesters on a shared-thread harness still see the advertised
  scoped tools; calling one returns a clean not-connected tool error for that
  requester. OpenClaw never falls back to another requester's credentials.

Memory prompt supplement builders receive optional `agentId`,
`agentSessionKey`, and `sandboxed` context. Memory corpus supplement `search`
and `get` calls receive optional `agentId` and `sandboxed` context. Plugins with
agent-owned storage should resolve that storage for each call instead of
capturing one global path during registration. If an agent id is required but
missing in a multi-agent operation, fail closed rather than choosing an
arbitrary agent.

Use `registerMemoryPromptPreparation(...)` when prompt text depends on async
plugin state. The callback runs once before each full agent prompt and receives
the same tool, agent, session, and sandbox context as synchronous memory prompt
builders. Validate the current storage-owner instance before loading persisted
state, then return only lines for that run. OpenClaw freezes those lines and
hands the immutable result to synchronous prompt assembly. Keep persistence,
atomic replacement, and owner-removal deletion inside the owning plugin; do not
poll or read files from a prompt builder.

Telegram interactive handlers can return `{ submitText }` to route text through
Telegram's normal inbound agent path after the handler succeeds. OpenClaw keeps
the callback button when inbound policy skips the text or processing fails, so
the user can retry after the blocking condition changes. This result field is
Telegram-specific; other channels keep their own interactive result contracts.

### Host hooks for workflow plugins

Host hooks are the SDK seams for plugins that need to participate in the host
lifecycle rather than only adding a provider, channel, or tool. They are
generic contracts; Plan Mode can use them, but so can approval workflows,
workspace policy gates, background monitors, setup wizards, and UI companion
plugins.

`registerBoardWidgetContentKind(...)` is for plugins that own a declarative
widget source format. The registration supplies a globally unique lowercase
`kind`, a short label, one capability-scoped plugin surface plus its renderer
resource paths, a synchronous `validateSource(source)` callback, and a
synchronous `composeDocument(...)` callback. Core adds the document shell,
sandbox, theme, and ticket-bound action bridge. Registrations exist only while
their plugin is active; invalid, reserved, or duplicate kinds fail plugin load.
Use `dashboard.dataBindings` and `dashboard.actionVerbs` for host capabilities,
not for renderer registration.

For inline rendering, `resources.readPublicResource(path)` can optionally return
`{ body: Uint8Array, contentType: string }` for the registered resource paths.
These bytes are public: the isolated sandbox listener serves them with no
Gateway credentials. Return only static renderer assets, never user data or
secrets. Unregistered paths and registrations without this callback stay private.
Opting in reserves every declared path in one global sandbox namespace: no other
content kind may declare the same path, even without a public reader. Registration
rejects these collisions regardless of order; only private registrations may
share paths. Public paths must already be canonical URL pathnames, without dot
segments, backslashes, query strings, or fragments. The sandbox host endpoint
`/mcp-app-sandbox` is reserved. These additional path restrictions apply only to
registrations with `readPublicResource`; private paths retain their capability
URL encoding.

A `surface: "tab"` descriptor adds a sidebar tab to the Control UI. Active
plugins' tab descriptors are advertised to dashboard clients in the gateway
hello (`controlUiTabs`), so the tab appears only while the plugin is enabled.
Bundled plugins may ship a first-class dashboard view for their tab; other
plugins can set `path` to a plugin HTTP route (see
`api.registerHttpRoute(...)`) that the dashboard renders in a sandboxed frame.
`icon` is a dashboard icon name hint, `group` picks the sidebar section
(`control` or `agent`), `order` sorts among plugin tabs, and `requiredScopes`
hides the tab from connections lacking those operator scopes:

Bundled plugins whose page already has a matching native Control UI route can set
`placement: "route:<pluginId>"`. The host rejects native-route claims from external
plugins or from bundled plugins whose ID does not own that route. The sidebar opens
the native route while the descriptor is present instead of mounting the generic
plugin-tab page.

For a gateway-protected external tab, register the descriptor `path` under a
same-plugin `auth: "gateway"` HTTP route. After authenticated bootstrap, the browser gets a
short-lived, HttpOnly grant scoped to that plugin and route root so the
sandboxed frame can load without copying the Gateway bearer token into its URL
or JavaScript. The authenticated parent renews the grant while the external tab
is active and before mounting it after navigation or browser resume. It also
probes the grant from the same opaque sandbox before mounting, so browser
privacy modes that block the cookie fail closed with an unavailable panel.
The frame grant accepts only `GET` and `HEAD` and always carries
`operator.read`; `requiredScopes` controls tab visibility but never widens the
cookie grant. Mutations remain on explicit Gateway-authenticated parent or
bearer surfaces. External tabs require HTTPS/Tailscale Serve or a
browser-trusted loopback origin; plain HTTP on a LAN host shows the
secure-context error instead of mounting a panel that cannot authenticate.
Full third-party-cookie blocking also makes gateway-protected tabs unavailable.
As with all native plugin surfaces, the frame remains inside the installed
plugin trust boundary; OpenClaw does not treat installed plugins as mutually
isolated browser security principals.
Cookie grants use the browser's hostname boundary, not its port boundary. Do
not cohost mutually untrusted services on the Gateway hostname, even on other
ports.
Tabs backed by plugin-managed auth keep their direct iframe behavior and do not
request or require this Gateway grant.

```typescript
api.session.controls.registerControlUiDescriptor({
  surface: "tab",
  id: "logbook",
  label: "Logbook",
  description: "Your day as a timeline, built from screen snapshots.",
  icon: "sun",
  group: "control",
  requiredScopes: ["operator.write"],
});
```

Use the grouped namespaces for new plugin code:

- `api.session.state.registerSessionExtension(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.enqueueNextTurnInjection(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.registerSessionSchedulerJob(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.sendSessionAttachment(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.scheduleSessionTurn(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.unscheduleSessionTurnsByTag(...)`
- `api.session.controls.registerSessionAction(...)`
- `api.session.controls.registerControlUiDescriptor(...)`
- `api.agent.events.registerAgentEventSubscription(...)`
- `api.agent.events.emitAgentEvent(...)`
- `api.runContext.setRunContext(...)` / `getRunContext(...)` / `clearRunContext(...)`
- `api.lifecycle.registerRuntimeLifecycle(...)`

The equivalent flat methods remain available as deprecated compatibility
aliases for existing plugins. Do not add new plugin code that calls
`api.registerSessionExtension`, `api.enqueueNextTurnInjection`,
`api.registerControlUiDescriptor`, `api.registerRuntimeLifecycle`,
`api.registerAgentEventSubscription`, `api.emitAgentEvent`,
`api.setRunContext`, `api.getRunContext`, `api.clearRunContext`,
`api.registerSessionSchedulerJob`, `api.registerSessionAction`,
`api.sendSessionAttachment`, `api.scheduleSessionTurn`, or
`api.unscheduleSessionTurnsByTag` directly.

`scheduleSessionTurn(...)` is a session-scoped convenience over the Gateway
Cron scheduler. Cron owns timing and creates the background task record when the
turn runs; the Plugin SDK only constrains the target session, plugin-owned
naming, and cleanup. Use `api.runtime.tasks.managedFlows` inside the scheduled
turn when the work itself needs durable multi-step Task Flow state.

Within session extensions, `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-sessions` provides the host's
model-selection helpers. Exact provider/model IDs take precedence over case-insensitive
matches; ambiguous references need exact provider and model IDs. Pass the provider
separately when distinct identities share a combined reference. Human-name
matching, alias/date version selection, and case-insensitive glob scopes remain
available.

Session extension SDK and supported TypeBox imports share the host's modules.

The contracts intentionally split authority:

- External plugins can own session extensions, UI descriptors, commands, tool
  metadata, next-turn injections, and normal hooks.
- Trusted tool policies run before ordinary `before_tool_call` hooks and are
  host-trusted. Bundled policies run first; installed-plugin policies require
  explicit enablement plus their local ids in
  `contracts.trustedToolPolicies`, and run next in plugin-load order. Policy ids
  are scoped to the registering plugin.
- Reserved command ownership is bundled-only. External plugins should use their
  own command names or aliases.
- `allowPromptInjection=false` disables prompt-mutating hooks including
  `agent_turn_prepare`, `before_prompt_build`, `heartbeat_prompt_contribution`,
  and `enqueueNextTurnInjection`.

Examples of non-Plan consumers:

| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approval workflow            | Session extension, command continuation, next-turn injection, UI descriptor                                                            |
| Budget/workspace policy gate | Trusted tool policy, tool metadata, session projection                                                                                 |

<Note>
  Reserved core admin namespaces (`config.*`, `exec.approvals.*`, `wizard.*`,
  `update.*`) always stay `operator.admin`, even if a plugin tries to assign a
  narrower gateway method scope. Prefer plugin-specific prefixes for
  plugin-owned methods.
</Note>

<Accordion title="When to use tool-result middleware">
  Bundled plugins and explicitly enabled installed plugins with matching
  manifest contracts can use `api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(...)` when
  they need to rewrite a tool result after execution and before the runtime
  feeds that result back into the model. This is the trusted runtime-neutral
  seam for async output reducers such as tokenjuice.

Plugins must declare `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware` for each targeted
runtime, for example `["openclaw", "codex"]`. Installed plugins without that
contract, or without explicit enablement, cannot register this middleware; keep
normal OpenClaw plugin hooks for work that does not need pre-model tool-result
timing. The old
embedded-runner-only extension factory registration path has been removed.
</Accordion>

### Gateway discovery registration

`api.registerGatewayDiscoveryService(...)` lets a plugin advertise the active
Gateway on a local discovery transport such as mDNS/Bonjour. OpenClaw calls the
service during Gateway startup when local discovery is enabled, passes the
current Gateway ports and non-secret TXT hint data, and calls the returned
`stop` handler during Gateway shutdown.

```typescript
api.registerGatewayDiscoveryService({
  id: "my-discovery",
  async advertise(ctx) {
    const handle = await startMyAdvertiser({
      gatewayPort: ctx.gatewayPort,
      tls: ctx.gatewayTlsEnabled,
      displayName: ctx.machineDisplayName,
    });
    return { stop: () => handle.stop() };
  },
});
```

Gateway discovery plugins must not treat advertised TXT values as secrets or
authentication. Discovery is a routing hint; Gateway auth and TLS pinning still
own trust.

### CLI registration metadata

`api.registerCli(registrar, opts?)` accepts two kinds of command metadata:

- `commands`: explicit command names owned by the registrar
- `descriptors`: parse-time command descriptors used for CLI help,
  routing, and lazy plugin CLI registration
- `parentPath`: optional parent command path for nested command groups, such as
  `["nodes"]`

For paired-node features, prefer
`api.registerNodeCliFeature(registrar, opts?)`. It is a small wrapper around
`api.registerCli(..., { parentPath: ["nodes"] })` and makes commands such as
`openclaw nodes canvas` explicit plugin-owned node features.

Reuse the core node CLI owners when a plugin-owned node command needs the same
Gateway flags, invoke envelope, terminal presentation, and authorization hints:

```typescript
import {
  buildNodeInvokeParams,
  getNodesTheme,
  nodesCallOpts,
  runNodesCommand,
} from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/node-cli-runtime";
```

If you want a plugin command to stay lazy-loaded in the normal root CLI path,
provide `descriptors` that cover every top-level command root exposed by that
registrar.

```typescript
api.registerCli(
  async ({ program }) => {
    const { registerMatrixCli } = await import("./src/cli.js");
    registerMatrixCli({ program });
  },
  {
    descriptors: [
      {
        name: "matrix",
        description: "Manage Matrix accounts, verification, devices, and profile state",
        hasSubcommands: true,
      },
    ],
  },
);
```

A root descriptor can also declare `machineOutput({ argv, stdoutIsTTY })` when
the command reserves stdout for JSON, JSONL, or another machine-readable format
without relying exclusively on a literal `--json` flag. OpenClaw evaluates this
resolver before plugin activation so startup diagnostics can be routed to
stderr. The resolver must be synchronous, pure, and dependency-light: inspect
only the supplied raw argv and stdout TTY state. Reuse the same resolver in
lightweight CLI metadata and full registration so discovery and execution do
not disagree. Use `getRootOptionAwareCommandPath` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/cli-argv` when the resolver needs command-path tokens; it
accepts supported root options before or after the command root. `machineOutput`
is root metadata; nested descriptors cannot use it because their owning root
must already be active before they are visible.

Nested commands receive the resolved parent command as `program`:

```typescript
api.registerCli(
  async ({ program }) => {
    const { registerNodesCanvasCommands } = await import("./src/cli.js");
    registerNodesCanvasCommands(program);
  },
  {
    parentPath: ["nodes"],
    descriptors: [
      {
        name: "canvas",
        description: "Present hosted widgets on a paired Mac",
        hasSubcommands: true,
      },
    ],
  },
);
```

Use `commands` by itself only when you do not need lazy root CLI registration.
That eager compatibility path remains supported, but it does not install
descriptor-backed placeholders for parse-time lazy loading.

### CLI backend registration

`api.registerCliBackend(...)` lets a plugin own the default config for a local
AI CLI backend such as `claude-cli` or `my-cli`.

- The backend `id` becomes the provider prefix in model refs like `my-cli/gpt-5`.
- The backend `config` is the authoritative command adapter: argv, environment,
  parser, session, image, and reliability behavior live in plugin code.
- Users select the backend through model refs or model-scoped `agentRuntime.id`;
  `openclaw.json` does not rewrite the adapter.
- Use `normalizeConfig` when registered static fields need a runtime-aware
  normalization pass.
- Use `resolveExecutionArgs` for request-scoped argv rewrites that belong to
  the CLI dialect, such as mapping OpenClaw thinking levels to a native effort
  flag. The hook receives `ctx.executionMode`; use `"side-question"` to add
  backend-native isolation flags for ephemeral `/btw` calls. If those flags
  reliably disable native tools for an otherwise always-on CLI, declare
  `sideQuestionToolMode: "disabled"` too.
- Use `prepareExecution` for backend-owned launch environment or temporary
  auth/config bridges. Its `ctx.contextTokenBudget` is the effective token
  limit selected for the run, so native-compaction backends can align their
  own threshold without provider-specific core branches. Its optional
  `ctx.thinkingLevel` is the effective `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`,
  `high`, `xhigh`, `adaptive`, or `max` selection for backends that apply the
  level through launch environment or staged configuration. It also receives
  the core-prepared `ctx.env` when backend staging must extend bundled MCP settings.
- Backends that can disable all native tools for a specific run may declare
  `nativeToolMode: "selectable"`. Restricted calls pass an exact
  `ctx.toolAvailability.native` list plus canonical
  `ctx.toolAvailability.openClaw` names. Declare
  `toolAvailabilityEnforcement: "execution-args"` and enforce the contract in
  final fresh/resume argv, or declare `"prepare-execution"`, enforce it in
  staged policy, and return `toolAvailabilityEnforced: true`. OpenClaw disables
  native tools for runtime caps such as cron `toolsAllow` and fails closed when
  the declared enforcement path is incomplete.

[CLI backend plugins](/plugins/cli-backend-plugins).

### Exclusive slots

| Method                                     | What it registers                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `api.registerContextEngine(id, factory)`   | Context engine (one active at a time). Use `info.acceptedHostParams` to restrict accepted host-added lifecycle fields, including optional `maintain()` cancellation; undeclared engines receive all current host fields. |
| `api.registerMemoryCapability(capability)` | Unified memory capability                                                                                                                                                                                                |

To participate in durable admitted turns, context engines must declare
`currentTurnFence: "before-current-turn-entry-v1"` and
`turnAdvancementIdempotency: "atomic-idempotent-v1"` under
`info.transcriptSemantics`, then implement `commitTurn(...)` as an atomic,
idempotent write keyed by `advancementKey`. OpenClaw supplies only the inclusive
accepted turn, from its admitted user entry through its terminal entry; use the
`readSessionTranscriptVisibleMessageDelta(...)` cursor API to bootstrap or
rebuild earlier history. Without the full contract, OpenClaw uses the legacy
context path for the whole logical turn and its retries, leaves the configured
engine unchanged, and tries that engine again on the next logical turn.

### Memory embedding adapters

- `registerMemoryCapability` is the exclusive memory-plugin API.
- `registerMemoryCapability` may also expose `publicArtifacts.listArtifacts(...)`
  for host-managed exports. Companion plugins that enumerate those declared
  artifacts still use `listActiveMemoryPublicArtifacts(...)` from the retained
  `openclaw/plugin-sdk/memory-host-core` facade until a focused public consumer
  API exists; they must not reach into another plugin's private layout.
- A memory runtime that can return session-transcript hits should implement
  `runtime.authorizeSearchHits(...)`. The host calls this hook before raw search
  hits reach caller-visible surfaces and supplies the requesting agent, session
  key, and sandbox state. Return only hits the requester may observe. If the hook
  is absent, OpenClaw fails closed by withholding session-source hits while
  retaining ordinary memory hits. Keep transcript identity and visibility
  policy in the owning memory plugin; callers must not infer authorization from
  paths or duplicate plugin-specific rules.
- `MemoryFlushPlan.model` can pin the flush turn to an exact `provider/model`
  reference, such as `ollama/qwen3:8b`, without inheriting the active fallback
  chain.
- Embedding providers use `api.registerEmbeddingProvider(...)` and
  `contracts.embeddingProviders`; there is no separate memory-only registry.

### Events and lifecycle

| Method                                       | What it does                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `api.on(hookName, handler, opts?)`           | Typed lifecycle hook          |
| `api.onConversationBindingResolved(handler)` | Conversation binding callback |

See [Plugin hooks](/plugins/hooks) for examples, common hook names, and guard
semantics.

### Hook decision semantics

`before_install` is a plugin-runtime lifecycle hook, not the operator install
policy surface. Use `security.installPolicy` when an allow/warn/block decision must
cover CLI and Gateway-backed install or update paths.

- `before_tool_call`: returning `{ block: true }` is terminal. Once any handler sets it, lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `before_tool_call`: returning `{ block: false }` is treated as no decision (same as omitting `block`), not as an override.
- `before_install`: returning `{ block: true }` is terminal. Once any handler sets it, lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `before_install`: returning `{ block: false }` is treated as no decision (same as omitting `block`), not as an override.
- `reply_dispatch`: returning `{ handled: true, ... }` is terminal. Once any handler claims dispatch, lower-priority handlers and the default model dispatch path are skipped.
- `message_sending`: returning `{ cancel: true }` is terminal. Once any handler sets it, lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `message_sending`: returning `{ cancel: false }` is treated as no decision (same as omitting `cancel`), not as an override.
- `message_received`: use the typed `threadId` field when you need inbound thread/topic routing. Keep `metadata` for channel-specific extras.
- `message_sending`: use typed `replyToId` / `threadId` routing fields before falling back to channel-specific `metadata`.
- `gateway_start`: use `ctx.config`, `ctx.workspaceDir`, and `ctx.getCron?.()` for gateway-owned startup state instead of relying on internal `gateway:startup` hooks. Cron may still be loading at this point.
- `cron_reconciled`: rebuild a full external cron projection after startup or scheduler reload. It includes `reason` and the effective `enabled` state, including `enabled: false`, while `ctx.getCron?.()` returns the exact reconciled scheduler. Pass `ctx.abortSignal` into durable projection work; it aborts when that scheduler snapshot is superseded or the Gateway closes.
- `cron_changed`: observe gateway-owned cron lifecycle changes. `scheduled` and `removed` events are post-commit reconciliation hints, not an ordered delta log. A scheduled event's `event.nextRunAtMs` is absent when the job has no next wake; a removed event still carries the deleted job snapshot.

External wake schedulers should debounce or coalesce `cron_changed` events,
then reread the full durable view from the scheduler last captured by
`cron_reconciled`. Do not adopt the scheduler from a `cron_changed` context: a
detached hint from an older scheduler can overlap a later reload.

Use `cron_reconciled` as the full-snapshot trigger for durable state loaded at
Gateway startup or scheduler replacement. It is not replayed for a plugin-only
hot reload. Observation handlers run in parallel, and fire-and-forget
dispatches can overlap, so consumers must not depend on event completion order.
Keep OpenClaw as the source of truth for due checks and execution.

For a single-flight adapter with durable replacement, retry/backoff, and clean
shutdown, see [Safe external cron projection](/plugins/hooks#safe-external-cron-projection).

| `api.rootDir`            | `string?`                 | Plugin root directory (optional)                                                          |
| `api.config`             | `OpenClawConfig`          | Current config snapshot (active in-memory runtime snapshot when available)                |
| `api.pluginConfig`       | `Record<string, unknown>` | Plugin-specific config from `plugins.entries.<id>.config`                                 |

## Internal module convention

Within your plugin, use local barrel files for internal imports:

```text
my-plugin/
  api.ts            # Public exports for external consumers
  runtime-api.ts    # Internal-only runtime exports
  index.ts          # Plugin entry point
  setup-entry.ts    # Lightweight setup-only entry (optional)
```

<Warning>
  Never import your own plugin through `openclaw/plugin-sdk/<your-plugin>`
  from production code. Route internal imports through `./api.ts` or
  `./runtime-api.ts`. The SDK path is the external contract only.
</Warning>

Facade-loaded bundled plugin public surfaces (`api.ts`, `runtime-api.ts`,
`index.ts`, `setup-entry.ts`, and similar public entry files) prefer the
active runtime config snapshot when OpenClaw is already running. If no runtime
snapshot exists yet, they fall back to the resolved config file on disk.
Packaged bundled plugin facades should be loaded through OpenClaw's plugin
facade loaders; direct imports from `dist/extensions/...` bypass the manifest
and runtime sidecar checks that packaged installs use for plugin-owned code.

Provider plugins can expose a narrow plugin-local contract barrel when a
helper is intentionally provider-specific and does not belong in a generic SDK
subpath yet. Bundled examples:

- **Anthropic**: public `api.ts` / `contract-api.ts` seam for Claude
  beta-header and `service_tier` stream helpers.
- **`@openclaw/openai-provider`**: `api.ts` exports provider builders,
  default-model helpers, and realtime provider builders.
- **`@openclaw/openrouter-provider`**: `api.ts` exports the provider builder
  plus onboarding/config helpers.

<Warning>
  Extension production code should also avoid `openclaw/plugin-sdk/<other-plugin>`
  imports. If a helper is truly shared, promote it to a neutral SDK subpath
  such as `openclaw/plugin-sdk/speech`, `.../provider-model-shared`, or another
  capability-oriented surface instead of coupling two plugins together.
</Warning>

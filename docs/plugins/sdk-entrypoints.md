read_when:
  - You need the exact type signature of defineToolPlugin, definePluginEntry, or defineChannelPluginEntry
  - You want to understand registration mode (full vs setup vs CLI metadata)
  - You are looking up entry point options
---

Every plugin exports a default entry object. The SDK provides a helper for
each entry shape: `defineToolPlugin`, `definePluginEntry`,
`defineChannelPluginEntry`, `defineSetupPluginEntry`.

All plugin APIs are [experimental](/plugins/sdk-overview#api-stability),
including these entry helpers. Pin and test the OpenClaw host versions your
plugin supports.

## Package entries

Installed plugins point `package.json` `openclaw` fields at both source and
built entries:

```json
{
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./src/index.ts"],
    "runtimeExtensions": ["./dist/index.js"],
    "setupEntry": "./src/setup-entry.ts",
    "runtimeSetupEntry": "./dist/setup-entry.js"
  }
}
```

- `extensions` and `setupEntry` are source entries, used for workspace and git
  checkout development.
- `runtimeExtensions` and `runtimeSetupEntry` select the built entries instead
  of the corresponding source entries.
- `runtimeExtensions`, when present, must match `extensions` in array length
  (entries pair positionally). `runtimeSetupEntry` requires `setupEntry`.
- If a `runtimeExtensions`/`runtimeSetupEntry` artifact is declared but
  missing, installation fails and discovery reports a packaging error for that
  entry; OpenClaw does not silently fall back to source.
- Without an explicit runtime entry, package discovery through
  `plugins.load.paths` or global roots looks for matching JavaScript peers under
  `dist/` first, then beside the TypeScript source entry. For `src/` entries,
  it checks both flattened `dist/` output and output retaining `dist/src/`.
  At each location, `.mts` prefers `.mjs` and `.cts` prefers `.cjs`; `.ts` and
  `.tsx` try `.js`, `.mjs`, then `.cjs`. Installation, discovery, setup, runtime
  loading, and published-package verification use the same candidate order.
- A `plugins.load.paths` entry that resolves inside the host's own bundled
  plugin tree is discovered as that bundled plugin, so it keeps the bundled
  entry point and bundled provenance whether or not compiled output exists
  beside the source. Selecting a bundled plugin's own path never reclassifies it.
- Package installation and managed installed-package discovery require compiled
  output for TypeScript extension and setup entries. Missing compiled output is
  a packaging error, not a reason to fall back to TypeScript.
- Trusted local/source development paths can use TypeScript when no runtime
  entry is declared. These include workspace plugins, explicit local load paths,
  untracked local plugin directories, and linked source checkouts. Workspace
  discovery keeps the source entry rather than inferring built peers.
- All entry paths must stay inside the plugin package directory. Runtime
  entries and inferred built-JS peers do not make an escaping `extensions` or
  `setupEntry` source path valid.

## `defineToolPlugin`

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/tool-plugin`

For plugins that only add agent tools. Keeps the source small, infers config
and tool-parameter types from TypeBox schemas, wraps plain return values in
the OpenClaw tool-result format, and exposes static metadata that
`openclaw plugins build` writes into the plugin manifest (`contracts.tools`,
`configSchema`).

```typescript
import { Type } from "typebox";
import { defineToolPlugin } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/tool-plugin";

export default defineToolPlugin({
  id: "stock-quotes",
  name: "Stock Quotes",
  description: "Fetch stock quotes.",
  configSchema: Type.Object({
    apiKey: Type.Optional(Type.String({ description: "API key." })),
  }),
  tools: (tool) => [
    tool({
      name: "quote",
      label: "Quote",
      description: "Fetch a quote.",
      parameters: Type.Object({
        symbol: Type.String({ description: "Ticker symbol." }),
      }),
      outputSchema: Type.Object(
        {
          symbol: Type.String(),
          hasKey: Type.Boolean(),
        },
        { additionalProperties: false },
      ),
      execute: async ({ symbol }, config) => ({ symbol, hasKey: Boolean(config.apiKey) }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

- `configSchema` is optional; omitting it uses a strict empty object schema
  (the generated manifest still includes `configSchema`).
- `execute` returns a plain string or JSON-serializable value; the helper
  wraps it as a text tool result with `details` set to the original
  (unstringified) return value.
- `outputSchema` optionally describes that original `details` value for Code
  Mode and Tool Search. Catalog calls reject an invalid schema before execution
  and validate the final value before returning it.
- For custom tool results, `openclaw/plugin-sdk/tool-results` exports
  `textResult` and `jsonResult`.
- Tool names are static, so `openclaw plugins build` derives
  `contracts.tools` from the declared tools without hand-duplicated names.
- Runtime loading stays strict: installed plugins still need
  `openclaw.plugin.json` and `package.json` `openclaw.extensions`. OpenClaw
  never executes plugin code to infer missing manifest data.

## `definePluginEntry`

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry`

For provider plugins, advanced tool plugins, hook plugins, and anything that
is **not** a messaging channel.

```typescript
import { definePluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry";

export default definePluginEntry({
  id: "my-plugin",
  name: "My Plugin",
  description: "Short summary",
  register(api) {
    api.registerProvider({/* ... */});
    api.registerTool({/* ... */});
  },
});
```

| Field                     | Type                                                             | Required | Default             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| `id`                      | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `name`                    | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `description`             | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `kind`                    | `string` (deprecated, see below)                                 | No       | -                   |
| `configSchema`            | `OpenClawPluginConfigSchema \| () => OpenClawPluginConfigSchema` | No       | Empty object schema |
| `reload`                  | `OpenClawPluginReloadRegistration`                               | No       | -                   |
| `nodeHostCommands`        | `OpenClawPluginNodeHostCommand[]`                                | No       | -                   |
| `securityAuditCollectors` | `OpenClawPluginSecurityAuditCollector[]`                         | No       | -                   |
| `register`                | `(api: OpenClawPluginApi) => void`                               | Yes      | -                   |

- `id` must match your `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest.
- External session catalogs use
  `openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-catalog` and register a
  `SessionCatalogProvider` with `api.registerSessionCatalog(...)`. Required
  provider fields are `id`, `label`, `list`, and `read`; optional hooks are
  `resolveCreateSession`, `continueSession`, `copyToGatewaySession`,
  `checkUpstreamActivity`, `archive`, `openTerminal`, and `startTerminalSession`.
  Core owns the
  `sessions.catalog.*` Gateway methods; providers return host, session,
  transcript, and terminal-plan projections without registering RPCs. A list
  provider should call the optional
  `onHost(host)` callback as each host settles; the returned host array remains
  required as the final compatibility snapshot.

  If a host can finish after `list` returns a fail-soft snapshot, register its
  bounded completion with the optional `waitUntil(completion: Promise<void>)`
  hook before `list` settles. Include host mapping and the `onHost` call in that
  promise. Use `publishSessionCatalogHost({ onHost, waitUntil }, pendingHost)`
  from the same SDK entry point to publish the host and register the complete
  callback chain. Registration after `list` settles is rejected. Providers that
  do not register completion work finish publishing when their `list` settles.

  The optional `signal: AbortSignal` belongs to the catalog operation or provider
  lifetime. Pass it to cancellable work, including the top-level `signal` field
  of `api.runtime.nodes.invoke(...)`. A requesting client disconnect only removes
  that client's subscription; it does not cancel shared discovery. Retaining
  completion does not extend native invocation or fail-soft response deadlines,
  grant new authority, or permit starting work after the owner retires. Providers
  remain responsible for bounded work that settles after cancellation.

  Keep `onHost`, `waitUntil`, and `signal` separate from validated catalog query
  objects and node command payloads. The request-owned `sessionEntries` snapshot
  and `listNodes` hook still must not be retained past `list`; prepare any facts
  needed by late host mapping before returning.

  Transcript items may include a `sender` with a qualified `SessionParticipant`
  identity and optional display label or avatar. Supply only source-known
  attribution; the viewer and the session adopter are not transcript authors.
  Core resolves profile identities against current profile data, including merges.
  User items without attribution display as **User**.

  A Gateway-hosted catalog may set `audience: "gateway-operators"` when every
  authenticated operator with `operator.read` may view its rows. Such a provider
  may implement `copyToGatewaySession(...)` to return a bounded display name and
  optional preferred model for an independent Gateway-owned continuation. Core
  owns operator and agent authorization, session creation, model readiness and
  policy checks, rollback, and untrusted-content wrapping. The provider supplies
  transcript text through `read(...)`; it must not write the destination session.

  Native source titles are presentation, not unique session labels. When adopting
  a new source, pass its title as `displayName` to the owner-authorized
  [session creator](/plugins/sdk-runtime); the host bounds and stores that snapshot
  with the new row. Keep source identity independent of naming, preserve existing
  labels and snapshots on reuse or recovery, and do not resync native renames.

  A provider may declare one readable transcript route with `shareRoute`. This
  is a closed contract, not a free-form routing hint:

  ```ts
  const shareRoute = {
    kind: "thread-id-prefix",
    routeSegment: "my-sessions",
    hostId: "gateway",
    identifierAlphabet: "lowercase-hex",
    fullLength: 32,
    minPrefixLength: 12,
    lookup: "catalog-list-search-by-thread-id-prefix",
    ambiguity: "multiple-results-or-next-cursor",
  } as const;
  ```

  The provider must return lowercase hexadecimal `threadId` values of exactly
  32 characters on the declared host. When `list(...)` receives a `search`
  value that is a valid 12-32 character prefix, that host must return only rows
  whose `threadId` starts with the prefix. Return every match up to the requested
  limit and set `nextCursor` when more may exist. The Control UI resolves only
  one result with no next page; multiple rows or `nextCursor` are explicitly
  ambiguous and never select the first row.

  Named share links use `/<routeSegment>/<title-slug>-<id-prefix>` with the same
  bounded slug as regular session links. Return the title in the catalog row's
  `name`; the Control UI uses it to refresh the decorative slug. Only the id
  suffix selects the transcript. Bare-id and stale-title links remain valid,
  and titles never resolve an ambiguous id.

  `routeSegment` must not use the first segment of a built-in Control UI route
  or alias, and it must be unique across active session catalogs. Invalid,
  unsupported, reserved, or multiply owned descriptors fail closed; catalog
  sessions remain available through the generic
  `/chat/<agent>?catalog=...&host=...&thread=...` URL. The shared session URL
  contract owns the built-in reservation decision: its share-path builder
  returns `null` for reserved segments, and the Gateway omits reserved
  descriptors before publishing catalogs. Keep one plugin-owned descriptor
  constant and reuse it for registration, prefix lookup, and URL generation so
  those obligations cannot drift.

  CLI-backed catalogs that expose the same local-plus-paired-node shape can use
  `createSessionCatalogFamily(...)`. The family composer owns canonical cursor
  validation, node payload validation, host projection, adopted-session
  projection, per-host publication, read routing, single-flight continuation
  per resolved agent and source, and terminal plan routing. Different agents
  do not share in-flight adoption results; adopted-source lookup keys remain
  host/thread pairs. The provider must supply its local store reads,
  identifiers and commands, error text, capability projection, continuation
  availability and persistence operations, upstream-activity check, and terminal
  executable/arguments. There are no default continuation, capability-mutation,
  or terminal authorities. Use `createSessionCatalogNodeHostBindings(...)` to
  build the matching list/read/terminal node commands and terminal-only invoke
  policy from those explicit provider inputs.

  The same entrypoint exports `sessionCatalogPaging`, which groups the bounded
  list/read parameter parsers, canonical base64url cursor codec, and bounded
  UTF-8 transcript pager. Providers pass their own identifier pattern and
  validation messages into `parseReadParams(...)` and `parseListParams(...)`.

  `resolveCreateSession({ agentId })` must return a config-derived model/runtime
  target before OpenClaw advertises model-chat creation. Native terminal readiness
  is independent of this target.
  Use
  [`api.runtime.agent.resolveSessionCatalogCreateTarget(...)`](/plugins/sdk-runtime#api-runtime-agent)
  to apply the host's runtime and model-allowlist policy instead of duplicating
  it.

  `startTerminalSession` advertises `capabilities.startTerminal: true` independently
  of model-chat creation. Return `canStartTerminal: true` on each eligible host
  from the ordinary catalog `list` callback, including empty hosts. Publish the
  same flag in progressive `onHost` frames and final results; explicitly return
  `false` when readiness changes. A failed transcript listing does not revoke
  an otherwise available CLI. Node hosts require their exact connected, invocable
  fresh-start command; start-only nodes must not invoke a missing list command.
  Preserve local source IDs and process-home isolation. The shipped
  `createSession.startTerminal` field remains model-chat metadata; new terminal
  callers use the independent capability and raw catalog hosts.

  `startTerminalSession({ agentId, cwd, initialMessage?, nodeId?, hostId? })` creates a
  fresh CLI terminal plan. Return either a local plan (`kind: "local"`, `argv`,
  and the exact `cwd`, plus optional `env`, `pathEnv`, and `title`) or a paired-node
  plan (`kind: "node"`, `nodeId`, `command`, `paramsJSON`, and the exact `cwd`).
  The `sessions.catalog.startTerminal` RPC requires `operator.admin` plus
  `gateway.cliAgents.enabled` and `gateway.terminal.enabled`. The caller
  provisions `cwd`; the Gateway requires an existing absolute local directory,
  rejects a changed plan cwd or host, and applies the normal agent-sandbox,
  node-pairing, deadline, and connection-ownership checks before opening the
  PTY. `hostId` carries the selected local source; `nodeId` identifies a node.
  Initial prompts are bounded to 16,384 characters and cwd to 4,096 characters
  (4,096 UTF-8 bytes on nodes).
  Fresh node commands use `decodeNodePtyStartParams` from `node-host` and
  `runNodePtyCommand({ ..., requiredCwd: true }, io)` to require an existing absolute
  node directory, including a recheck immediately before spawning. Resume retains
  its existing cwd fallback contract. Node payloads must not accept executable,
  argv, environment, credentials, or a Gateway agent as native account selection.

  The terminal manager retains the native title and actual connection/agent owner
  across attach and reconnect. Clients advertise `terminal-session-metadata` to
  receive attach title/owner and list titles; older closed response shapes stay
  unchanged.

- `kind` is deprecated: declare an exclusive slot (`"memory"` or
  `"context-engine"`) in the `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest `kind` field
  instead. Runtime-entry `kind` remains only as a compatibility fallback for
  older plugins.
- `configSchema` can be a function for lazy evaluation. OpenClaw resolves and
  memoizes the schema on first access, so expensive schema builders only run
  once.
- A `nodeHostCommands` descriptor can define `isAvailable({ config, env })`.
  Returning `false` omits that command and its capability from the headless
  node's Gateway declaration. OpenClaw evaluates it against the node-local
  startup config; command handlers should still validate availability when
  invoked.

### Native provider factories

`registerSpeechProvider`, `registerRealtimeTranscriptionProvider`, and
`registerRealtimeVoiceProvider` accept either a complete provider descriptor or
a synchronous factory receiving `PluginCapabilityCatalogContext`:

```typescript
register(api) {
  api.registerRealtimeTranscriptionProvider((context) =>
    buildRealtimeTranscriptionProvider(context),
  );
}
```

Use the same plugin-owned factory for full registration and an optional
capability catalog. The host supplies native auth, request, and transport
operations; constructing a descriptor should not load execution SDK barrels,
read credentials, or start sessions. Keep that work in the descriptor's methods.
Factories must return synchronously; a thrown error or promise fails registration.

Full registration can bind its own broker or logger in the factory closure.
Do not substitute a catalog-only descriptor for one that requires those bindings.
Full plugin registration still owns harnesses, hooks, services, and lifecycle
callbacks; catalog entries alone do not establish runtime readiness.

Object registrations remain supported. Before publishing a plugin that uses
factory arguments, set its `compat.pluginApi` floor to a host release that
supports them; a lower `minHostVersion` does not override that API requirement.

### Computer Use providers

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/computer-use`

Node-local Computer Use plugins register one provider through
`registerComputerUseProvider(api, provider)`. The helper owns the
`screen.snapshot` and dangerous `computer.act` command registrations and the
matching Gateway invoke policy; the provider owns availability, execution,
serialization, frame state, driver lifecycle, and cleanup.

The same entry point exports the canonical TypeBox schemas, static types, and
compiled validators for the two command payloads and the snapshot result. A
node host accepts one provider for the command pair; registering another
provider conflicts with the existing command registration instead of creating
a fallback stack.

## `defineChannelPluginEntry`

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core`

Wraps `definePluginEntry` with channel-specific wiring: it automatically
calls `api.registerChannel({ plugin })`, exposes an optional root-help CLI
metadata seam, and gates capability and full-runtime callbacks on registration
mode.

```typescript
import { defineChannelPluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core";

export default defineChannelPluginEntry({
  id: "my-channel",
  name: "My Channel",
  description: "Short summary",
  plugin: myChannelPlugin,
  setRuntime: setMyRuntime,
  registerCliMetadata(api) {
    api.registerCli(/* ... */);
  },
  registerFull(api) {
    api.registerGatewayMethod(/* ... */);
  },
  registerCapabilities(api) {
    api.registerTranscriptSourceProvider(/* ... */);
  },
});
```

| Field                  | Type                                                             | Required | Default             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| `id`                   | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `name`                 | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `description`          | `string`                                                         | Yes      | -                   |
| `plugin`               | `ChannelPlugin`                                                  | Yes      | -                   |
| `configSchema`         | `OpenClawPluginConfigSchema \| () => OpenClawPluginConfigSchema` | No       | Empty object schema |
| `setRuntime`           | `(runtime: PluginRuntime) => void`                               | No       | -                   |
| `registerCliMetadata`  | `(api: OpenClawPluginApi) => void`                               | No       | -                   |
| `registerFull`         | `(api: OpenClawPluginApi) => void`                               | No       | -                   |
| `registerCapabilities` | `(api: OpenClawPluginApi) => void`                               | No       | -                   |

Callbacks run per registration mode (full table under
[Registration mode](#registration-mode)):

- `setRuntime` runs in every mode except `"cli-metadata"` and
  `"tool-discovery"`. Store the runtime reference here, typically via
  `createPluginRuntimeStore`.
- `registerCliMetadata` runs for `"cli-metadata"`, `"discovery"`, and
  `"full"`. Use it as the canonical place for channel-owned CLI descriptors
  so root help stays non-activating, discovery snapshots include static
  command metadata, and normal CLI registration stays compatible with full
  plugin loads.
- `registerFull` runs only for `"full"` and `"tool-discovery"`. For
  `"tool-discovery"` it runs _instead of_ channel registration: OpenClaw
  skips `registerChannel`/`setRuntime` entirely and calls the full-runtime
  callback followed by the capability callback. Keep tool registration in
  `registerFull` and capability providers in `registerCapabilities`.
- `registerCapabilities` runs for `"discovery"`, `"full"`, and
  `"tool-discovery"`. Register inert advertised providers here so read-only
  capability discovery can find them without starting sockets, clients,
  workers, or services.
- Discovery registration is non-activating, not import-free: OpenClaw may
  evaluate the trusted plugin entry and channel plugin module to build the
  snapshot. Keep top-level imports side-effect-free and put sockets,
  clients, workers, and services behind `"full"`-only paths.
- Like `definePluginEntry`, `configSchema` can be a lazy factory; OpenClaw
  memoizes the resolved schema on first access.

CLI registration:

- Use `api.registerCli(..., { descriptors: [...] })` for plugin-owned root
  CLI commands you want lazy-loaded without disappearing from the root CLI
  parse tree. Descriptor names must match letters, numbers, hyphen, and
  underscore, starting with a letter or number; OpenClaw rejects other
  shapes and strips terminal control sequences from descriptions before
  rendering help. Cover every top-level command root the registrar exposes,
  and declare the same name, description, and subcommand marker in the
  plugin manifest's `cliCommands` field so root help does not import plugin code.
  `commands` alone stays on the eager compatibility path.
- Root descriptors may define a synchronous, pure
  `machineOutput({ argv, stdoutIsTTY })` resolver for JSON, JSONL, or other
  machine-readable stdout modes that are not selected solely by `--json`.
  Parse command tokens with `getRootOptionAwareCommandPath` from
  `openclaw/plugin-sdk/cli-argv`. Keep the descriptor in a lightweight
  plugin-local module and reuse it from both `cli-metadata.ts` and full
  registration; do not import runtime barrels to construct metadata.
  Meeting runtime shells accept that descriptor through `cli.descriptor`.
  Nested descriptors do not expose `machineOutput`.
- Use `api.registerNodeCliFeature(...)` for paired-node feature commands so
  they land under `openclaw nodes` (equivalent to
  `registerCli(registrar, { parentPath: ["nodes"], ... })`).
- For other nested plugin commands, add `parentPath` and register commands
  on the `program` object passed to the registrar; OpenClaw resolves it to
  the parent command before calling the plugin.
- For channel plugins, register CLI descriptors from `registerCliMetadata`
  and keep `registerFull` focused on runtime-only work.
- If `registerFull` also registers gateway RPC methods, keep them on a
  plugin-specific prefix. Reserved core admin namespaces (`config.*`,
  `exec.approvals.*`, `wizard.*`, `update.*`) always coerce to
  `operator.admin`.

## `defineSetupPluginEntry`

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core`

For the lightweight `setup-entry.ts` file. Returns just `{ plugin }` with no
runtime or CLI wiring.

```typescript
import { defineSetupPluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core";

export default defineSetupPluginEntry(myChannelPlugin);
```

OpenClaw loads this instead of the full entry when a channel is disabled or
unconfigured. See
[Setup and Config](/plugins/sdk-setup#setup-entry) for when this matters.

Pair `defineSetupPluginEntry(...)` with the narrow setup helper families:

| Import                                  | Use for                                                                                                                                                                            |

Keep heavy SDKs, CLI registration, and long-lived runtime services in the
full entry.

Bundled workspace channels that split setup and runtime surfaces can use
`defineBundledChannelSetupEntry(...)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-entry-contract` instead. It lets the setup
entry keep setup-safe plugin/secrets exports while still exposing a runtime
setter:

```typescript
import { defineBundledChannelSetupEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-entry-contract";

export default defineBundledChannelSetupEntry({
  importMetaUrl: import.meta.url,
  plugin: {
    specifier: "./channel-plugin-api.js",
    exportName: "myChannelPlugin",
  },
  runtime: {
    specifier: "./runtime-api.js",
    exportName: "setMyChannelRuntime",
  },
  registerSetupRuntime(api) {
    api.registerHttpRoute({
      path: "/my-channel/events",
      auth: "plugin",
      handler: async (req, res) => {
        /* setup-safe route */
      },
    });
  },
});
```

Use this only when a setup flow truly needs a lightweight runtime setter or
setup-safe gateway surface for an unconfigured channel.
`registerSetupRuntime` runs only for `"setup-runtime"` loads; keep it
limited to config-only routes or methods required by that setup flow.

## Registration mode

`api.registrationMode` tells your plugin how it was loaded:

| Mode               | When                                               | Runtime     | What to register                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"full"`           | Normal gateway startup                             | Live        | Everything                                                                                                      |
| `"discovery"`      | Read-only capability discovery                     | Live        | Channel registration, static CLI descriptors, and inert providers; skip sockets, workers, clients, and services |
| `"tool-discovery"` | Scoped load to list or run specific plugins' tools | Live        | Capability/tool registration only; no channel activation                                                        |
| `"setup-only"`     | Disabled/unconfigured channel                      | Unavailable | Channel registration only                                                                                       |
| `"setup-runtime"`  | Setup flow with runtime available                  | Live        | Channel registration plus only the lightweight runtime needed during setup                                      |
| `"cli-metadata"`   | Root help / CLI metadata capture                   | Unavailable | CLI descriptors only                                                                                            |

In `"cli-metadata"` and `"setup-only"` modes, accessing a runtime capability throws an error naming the plugin and mode. Defer runtime access out of `register()` or declare root commands in the manifest's `cliCommands` so CLI metadata can be collected without executing the plugin.

`defineChannelPluginEntry` handles this split automatically. If you use
`definePluginEntry` directly for a channel, check mode yourself and remember
`"tool-discovery"` skips channel registration:

```typescript
register(api) {
  if (
    api.registrationMode === "cli-metadata" ||
    api.registrationMode === "discovery" ||
    api.registrationMode === "full"
  ) {
    api.registerCli(/* ... */);
    if (api.registrationMode === "cli-metadata") return;
  }

  if (api.registrationMode === "tool-discovery") {
    // Register capability-only surfaces (providers/tools), no channel.
    return;
  }

  api.registerChannel({ plugin: myPlugin });
  if (api.registrationMode !== "full") return;

  // Heavy runtime-only registrations
  api.registerService(/* ... */);
}
```

Long-lived services may emit small invalidation or lifecycle events through
their service context:

```typescript
api.registerService({
  id: "index-events",
  start(ctx) {
    ctx.gatewayEvents?.emit("changed", { revision: 1 }, { scope: "operator.read" });
  },
});
```

OpenClaw namespaces this as `plugin.<plugin-id>.changed`. Event names are one
lowercase segment, payloads must be bounded JSON, and the scope must be
`operator.read`, `operator.write`, or `operator.admin`. The emitter exists only
for the service lifetime and is revoked after stop or failed start. Prefer
version or invalidation payloads over full records so authorized clients reread
canonical state through the plugin's scoped Gateway methods.

Discovery mode builds a non-activating registry snapshot. It may still
evaluate the plugin entry and the channel plugin object so OpenClaw can
register channel capabilities and static CLI descriptors. Treat module
evaluation in discovery as trusted but lightweight: no network clients,
subprocesses, listeners, database connections, background workers,
credential reads, or other live runtime side effects at top level.

Treat `"setup-runtime"` as the window where setup-only startup surfaces must
exist without re-entering the full bundled channel runtime. Good fits are
channel registration, setup-safe HTTP routes, setup-safe gateway methods,
and delegated setup helpers. Heavy background services, CLI registrars, and
provider/client SDK bootstraps still belong in `"full"`.

## Plugin shapes

OpenClaw classifies loaded plugins by their registration behavior:

| Shape                 | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **plain-capability**  | One capability type (e.g. provider-only)           |
| **hybrid-capability** | Multiple capability types (e.g. provider + speech) |
| **hook-only**         | Only hooks, no capabilities                        |
| **non-capability**    | Tools/commands/services but no capabilities        |

Use `openclaw plugins inspect <id>` to see a plugin's shape.

Operator scopes gate what a Gateway client can do after it authenticates.
They are a control-plane guardrail inside one trusted Gateway operator domain,
not hostile multi-tenant isolation. For strong separation between people,
teams, or machines, run separate Gateways under separate OS users or hosts.

## Connection roles

Every Gateway WebSocket client connects with one role:

- `operator`: control-plane clients such as CLI, Control UI, automation, and
  trusted helper processes.
- `node`: capability hosts (macOS, iOS, Android, headless) that expose
  commands through `node.invoke`.

Operator RPC methods require the `operator` role; node-originated methods
require the `node` role.

## Scope levels

| Scope                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operator.read`         | Read-only status, lists, catalog, logs, session reads, retained audit and execution-identity diagnostics, and other non-mutating calls.                       |
| `operator.write`        | Mutating operator actions: sending messages, invoking tools, updating talk/voice settings, node command relay. Also satisfies `operator.read`.                |
| `operator.admin`        | Administrative access. Satisfies every `operator.*` scope. Required for config mutation, updates, native hooks, reserved namespaces, and high-risk approvals. |
| `operator.pairing`      | Device and node pairing management: list, approve, reject, remove, rotate, revoke.                                                                            |
| `operator.approvals`    | Exec and plugin approval APIs.                                                                                                                                |
| `operator.questions`    | Listing, reading, answering, and resolving interactive questions.                                                                                             |
| `operator.talk`         | Creating, steering, and closing Talk sessions without general Gateway write access. `operator.write` also satisfies this scope.                               |
| `operator.talk.secrets` | Reading Talk configuration with secrets included.                                                                                                             |

Personal GitHub connection management is a narrowly self-scoped exception to
read-only behavior: `users.github.*` requires `operator.read` plus the exact
authenticated durable profile. An identified reader can connect, poll, cancel,
reconnect, or disconnect only their own account. These methods do not expose
team secrets, mutate shared configuration, or grant OpenClaw write/admin scopes. System
and per-agent GitHub changes remain `operator.admin`; publication remains
`operator.write` plus current session authorization. See
[GitHub connections](/concepts/user-model#github-connections).

Unknown future `operator.*` scopes require an exact match unless the caller
already holds `operator.admin`.

## Named operator roles

Team Gateways can bind authenticated user profiles to named operator roles.
Each role combines four closed policies: access to other people's sessions,
agents available for session creation and agent runs, a maximum set of operator
scopes, and whether newly created sessions require sandboxing.

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    roles: {
      default: "guest",
      definitions: {
        maintainer: {
          sessions: { others: "write" },
          agents: ["roboclaw"],
          scopes: ["operator.read", "operator.write", "operator.approvals"],
        },
        guest: {
          sessions: { others: "view" },
          agents: ["roboclaw"],
          scopes: ["operator.read", "operator.write"],
          sandbox: "required",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Use the administrator-scoped `users.setRole` Gateway method with
`{ profileId, role }` to assign a configured role; set `role: null` to clear an
assignment. Assignment changes immediately invalidate and close that profile's
active Gateway connections; reconnecting applies the current role and scope
ceiling. `gateway.roles.default` is required whenever roles are configured,
must name an existing definition, and applies to profiles without a valid
assigned role. Omitting `gateway.roles` entirely leaves solo and shared-secret
deployments unchanged.

When roles are configured, identity-authenticated operator connections do not
receive reusable device or bootstrap tokens: those tokens are not bound to a
person and could bypass the role ceiling. Device-token or bootstrap-token
authentication without a verified user identity is rejected for operator
Gateway connections and HTTP requests. Reconnect through the trusted proxy or
another supported verified identity, such as Tailscale; node connections,
shared-secret/password access, and Gateways without role configuration retain
their existing behavior.

For sessions created by other people, `sessions.others` supports these values:

- `"none"`: hides foreign sessions from lists and targeted access, filters
  session-level usage to visible sessions, and denies Gateway-wide `usage.cost`
  because its aggregate can include hidden sessions.
- `"view"`: allows reading but does not allow mutation, even when a session is
  otherwise shared.
- `"suggest"`: allows viewing and the existing suggestion flow.
- `"write"`: allows participation in foreign sessions; draft and incognito
  restrictions remain in force.

A person always owns their own sessions. Explicit session membership can raise
`"view"` or `"suggest"` access for a specific session, and connections already
holding `operator.admin` retain their administrative session access.

Set `agents: "*"` to allow session creation and agent runs on every agent, list
agent IDs to allow only those agents, or use an empty array to disallow both.
The allowlist also applies when a run targets an already-existing session.

The optional `sandbox` policy defaults to `"inherit"`, which keeps the agent's
configured sandbox mode. Set `sandbox: "required"` to sandbox every new session
created by an authenticated person with that role, even when the agent's
sandbox mode is `"off"`. The example lets maintainers use host execution on
`roboclaw` while guest-created sessions on the same agent remain sandboxed.

Required sandboxes are isolated per authenticated session creator, not merely
per agent or per session. Different guests using the same agent receive separate
sandbox environments and workspaces; multiple sessions created by the same guest
reuse that guest's environment and workspace. This per-guest boundary applies
regardless of the configured sandbox scope. If the agent configures
`workspaceAccess: "rw"`, OpenClaw reduces access to `"ro"` for role-required
sessions and logs an `agent/sandbox` warning, preventing the shared agent
workspace from becoming a writable bridge between guests. Maintainer sessions
and other sessions without a role-required sandbox keep their configured scope
and workspace access.

The Gateway records the authenticated creator and their sandbox requirement
together before a new session first runs, including chat, Talk, recovery,
forks, checkpoint branches, cron, outbound messages, and spawned children.
Delegated child work inherits a required parent's original creator and sandbox
policy, even after role changes. Recovery and branching requested by another
person use that person's own role rather than the source session's policy.

Required creation provenance is immutable. Role changes, sharing, participation,
`sessions.patch`, whole-entry replacement, legacy imports, and canonical-key
repair cannot remove or replace an existing required stamp. Blocked persisted
overwrites emit a `session-sqlite` warning; inspect them with
[`openclaw logs --follow`](/cli/logs). Existing unstamped sessions and new sessions
whose creator does not require sandboxing retain their existing behavior.

A person whose role requires sandboxing cannot start a run in an existing
host-execution session, even when explicitly invited. Required sessions
fail if their sandbox backend is unavailable or provisioning fails; they never
fall back to the Gateway or a node. `/elevated`, `exec` host overrides, and
configured host targets cannot bypass this restriction. The agent's managed
GitHub identity is not injected into sandboxed execution: `GH_CONFIG_DIR` is
absent, and `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are blanked.

The role's `scopes` list caps scopes granted through connection auth, identity
grants, pairing, scope upgrades, and authenticated trusted-proxy HTTP requests.
The ceiling uses the normal scope implications: `operator.admin` permits every
operator scope, and `operator.write` permits `operator.read` and `operator.talk`.
It only filters existing grants; it cannot add scopes the connection did not
already receive.
This includes plugin HTTP requests and WebSocket upgrades: without a scope
header, ordinary Gateway-authenticated plugin routes start with only
`operator.write`, then apply the role ceiling. Read-only and empty roles
therefore receive no runtime scopes on that default path.
Control UI plugin grants carry the authenticated profile inside a signed
cookie; plugin HTTP requests reapply the profile's current role ceiling and
reject grants without a matching durable identity when roles are enabled.
Include `operator.admin` explicitly only when that role should retain
administrative connection authority.

Named roles apply only to connections with an authenticated durable user
profile. They organize collaboration within one trusted Gateway domain and do
not replace separate Gateways when hostile-tenant isolation is required.
Diagnostic audit methods, including `audit.run.inspect`, remain shared-domain
`operator.read` surfaces and are not filtered by session role. Likewise,
`operator.write` still authorizes Gateway-wide operations such as tool
invocation, ordinary node command relay, and other write-scoped control-plane
actions; session restrictions do not turn that scope into a per-person
isolation boundary. Use separate Gateways when mutually untrusted people must
not share diagnostics or control-plane write authority.

## Identity scope grants

`gateway.auth.identityScopes` grants operator scopes to verified user
identities from trusted-proxy auth or Tailscale WhoIs:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    auth: {
      identityScopes: {
        "admin@example.com": ["operator.admin"],
        "operator@example.com": ["operator.read", "operator.write"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The key is the verified proxy identity or Tailscale WhoIs login. Email keys
match case-insensitively; non-email identities match exactly. Config validation
rejects scope names outside the closed set above.

Connection authority is resolved in this order:

1. For trusted-proxy Control UI connections, `x-openclaw-scopes` first caps
   device enrollment or upgrade requests. Device authorization then establishes
   the persistent scopes; a device-less session contributes no self-declared
   scopes.
2. OpenClaw unions a matching server-side identity grant with those scopes.
3. OpenClaw applies `x-openclaw-scopes` to the final union as the session cap.
   An absent header means no cap; a present-but-empty header yields no scopes.
4. If the authenticated profile has an effective named operator role,
   OpenClaw intersects the result with that role's configured scope ceiling.

The result is used for both `hello.auth.scopes` and Gateway method
authorization. Identity grants are session-only: they do not create or modify
pairing records or request a device scope upgrade. Token, password, and no-auth
connections carry no verified identity and receive no grant.
Identity grants apply only to `operator`-role connections; `node`-role connections never receive them.

## Method scope is only the first gate

Each Gateway RPC has a least-privilege method scope that decides whether a
request reaches its handler. Params-aware methods derive that scope before
dispatch so authorization failures have one canonical structured response:

- `agent` needs `operator.write` for ordinary turns and `operator.admin` for
  `/new` or `/reset` session lifecycle commands.
- `node.invoke` needs `operator.write` for ordinary relay commands and
  `operator.admin` when relaying `browser.proxy`, `browser.proxy.upload.v1`,
  `fs.listDir`, or `terminal.upload` to a node.
- The top-level `fs.listDir` RPC needs `operator.write` for Gateway-host
  requests and `operator.admin` when `nodeId` targets a node. Its handler limits
  non-admin Gateway-host browsing to configured agent workspaces.
- `plugins.sessionAction` requires every scope declared in the selected action's
  `requiredScopes`; omitted or empty lists default to `operator.write`.
  `operator.write` satisfies `operator.read` and `operator.talk`. Other scopes
  require an exact match, or `operator.admin`.
- `sessions.create` needs `operator.write` for ordinary creation, including a
  `projectId`, and `operator.admin` for incognito sessions or any `execNode`
  request. For non-admin callers, the handler limits `cwd` to configured agent
  workspaces; `projectId` cannot be combined with `cwd` or `execNode`.
- `environments.list` needs `operator.read`. Session placement methods derive
  their scope from the requested target before schema validation:
  `sessions.dispatch` needs `operator.write` for `deviceId` and
  `operator.admin` for `profileId` or a target-less
  `cloudWorkers.projectProfiles` lookup; `sessions.move` needs `operator.write`
  for Gateway or device targets and `operator.admin` for profile targets;
  `abandonSource: true` remains `operator.write` but is schema-valid only with
  a Gateway target and runtime-valid only for an exact offline device source;
  `sessions.reclaim` remains `operator.write`. Malformed dispatch params or a
  malformed move target use `operator.write` so the handler can return the
  precise schema error. All three methods retain session ownership,
  participation, and commit-time revalidation fences. `operator.read` alone
  cannot start, stop, or move a session. Cloud profile allocation and mutation,
  pairing and Connect machine, raw `environments.create` or
  `environments.destroy`, incognito sessions, direct `execNode` execution, and
  arbitrary host or node paths remain `operator.admin`.
- `worktrees.branches` needs `operator.write`. Its handler limits non-admin
  callers to workspace-contained paths or registered-project roots; other host
  paths require `operator.admin`.
- `talk.config` needs `operator.read`; `includeSecrets: true` also needs
  `operator.talk.secrets`.
- `talk.client.*`, `talk.session.*`, `talk.speak`, and `talk.mode` need
  `operator.talk` (or the compatible broader `operator.write`).
- `sessions.patch` needs `operator.write` for session organization fields and
  the per-session `model` override. Other runtime overrides, including
  thinking, fast, verbose, trace, and reasoning levels, need `operator.admin`.
  Persisting a selected model as the configured agent default is also
  admin-only.

Project RPCs use these scopes:

| Method                                 | Required scope and additional gate                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `projects.list`                        | `operator.read`; only callers satisfying `operator.write` receive `repoRoot` and `originUrl`. |
| `projects.add`                         | `operator.write` and the `controlPlaneWrite` method flag.                                     |
| `projects.register`, `projects.remove` | `operator.admin`.                                                                             |
| `projects.searchRemote`                | `operator.read`.                                                                              |

Some handlers then apply stricter checks based on the concrete thing being
approved or mutated:

- `device.pair.approve` is reachable with `operator.pairing`, but approving an
  operator device can only mint or preserve scopes the caller already holds.
- `node.pair.approve` is reachable with `operator.pairing`, then derives extra
  approval scopes from the pending node's declared command list.
- `chat.send` is a write-scoped method, but the `/config set` and
  `/config unset` chat commands require `operator.admin` on top of that,
  regardless of the caller's chat-send scope.

This lets lower-scope operators perform low-risk pairing actions without
making all pairing approval admin-only.

Session mutation RPCs are authorized by their negotiated operator scopes,
independent of the connecting client's `client.id` or `client.mode`. Client
identity can still affect connection and device-auth policy, but it neither
grants nor removes session mutation authority.

`audit.run.inspect` intentionally uses `operator.read`. Every client with that
scope in a Gateway operator domain may receive the retained execution-identity
context, including bounded pseudonymized references and secret-redacted display
labels. `operator.read` is not a per-user or hostile multi-tenant privacy
boundary. Operators who must keep this data separate need separate Gateway
trust domains.

## Device pairing approvals

Device pairing records are the durable source of approved roles and scopes.
An already-paired device does not get broader access silently: a reconnect
that asks for a broader role or broader scopes creates a new pending upgrade
request.

A connected limited Control UI can file that same pending request through
**Inbox > System > Limited access > Request admin** without attempting a broader
reconnect. The request is bound to the signed device identity on the live connection. Approval still
comes from `device.pair.approve` and therefore requires `operator.pairing` plus
authority for every requested scope. After approval rotates the operator token,
the Gateway returns the new token only to that device's live waiter; the browser
stores it before reconnecting. Canceling the wait or disconnecting before
approval falls back to the ordinary pairing repair flow on the next connection.

A role with only `operator.admin` permits the Control UI's full operator scope
request. Approval is still required; the role ceiling does not grant device
scopes on its own.

Requests outside the authenticated person's assigned role ceiling are denied,
not queued for device approval. The Gateway checks the current role again after
approval, before returning the token, so a role demotion during the wait still
blocks an out-of-role result. The Control UI shows the denial and administrator
guidance without **Retry**; an administrator must change the role first.

The explicit exception is the administrator-capable Control UI owner profile
issued directly on the Gateway host by `openclaw dashboard` or graphical
onboarding. Its short-lived, single-use bootstrap can approve the exact closed
scope set for a fresh browser or upgrade an existing limited credential only
when it binds to that same signed browser keypair. Generic Control UI and
Telegram handoffs, mobile setup profiles, shared credentials, locality, and
caller-selected scopes do not receive this exception.

Approving a device request:

- A request with no operator role does not need operator scope approval.
- A request for a non-operator device role (for example `node`) requires
  `operator.admin`, even though `device.pair.approve` itself only needs
  `operator.pairing`.
- A request for `operator.read`, `operator.write`, `operator.approvals`,
  `operator.questions`, `operator.pairing`, `operator.talk`, or
  `operator.talk.secrets` requires
  the caller to already hold that scope, or `operator.admin`.
- A request for `operator.admin` requires `operator.admin`.
- A repair request with no explicit scopes can inherit the existing operator
  token's scopes; if that token is admin-scoped, approval still requires
  `operator.admin`.

Non-admin shared-secret and trusted-proxy sessions can only approve
operator-device requests within their own declared operator scopes; approving
non-operator roles is admin-only even when those sessions can otherwise use
`operator.pairing`.

For paired-device token sessions, management is self-scoped unless the caller
has `operator.admin`: a non-admin caller sees only its own pairing entries, and
can approve, reject, rotate, revoke, or remove only its own device entry.

## Node pairing approvals

`node.pair.*` capability approvals are stored on the paired device record in
the shared SQLite pairing store. Gateways migrate any remaining entries from
the retired standalone `nodes/paired.json` store into those records once at
startup. See [Gateway pairing](/gateway/pairing) for details.

`node.pair.approve` derives extra required scopes from the pending request's
command list:

| Declared commands                                                                                                                               | Required scopes                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| none                                                                                                                                            | `operator.pairing`                    |
| ordinary node commands                                                                                                                          | `operator.pairing` + `operator.write` |
| `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`, `browser.proxy`, `browser.proxy.upload.v1`, `fs.listDir`, or `system.execApprovals.get/set` | `operator.pairing` + `operator.admin` |

Here, `fs.listDir` is the node command declared for relay through `node.invoke`,
not the top-level Gateway RPC described above.

Approving a node declaration records its command surface. For `computer.act`,
the node advertises that surface only after Computer Control is enabled locally;
once the pairing update is approved, invoking it through `node.invoke` requires
write scope but not admin scope for each action. Commands classified as
dangerous or privacy-heavy still require a persistent
`gateway.nodes.commands.allow` entry in addition to pairing.

Node pairing establishes identity and trust; it does not replace a node's own
`system.run` exec approval policy.

## Shared-secret auth

Shared gateway token/password auth is treated as trusted operator access for
that Gateway. OpenAI-compatible HTTP surfaces, `/tools/invoke`, and HTTP
session-history endpoints restore the full default operator scope set for
shared-secret bearer auth, even if a caller sends narrower declared scopes.

Identity-bearing modes, such as trusted proxy auth or private-ingress `none`,
can still honor explicit declared scopes. Use separate Gateways for real trust
boundary separation.

The Gateway WS protocol is the single control plane and node transport for
OpenClaw. Operator and node clients (CLI, web UI, macOS app, iOS/Android nodes,
headless nodes) connect over WebSocket and declare a **role** and **scope** at
handshake time.

## npm packages

The verified stable package release is `2026.8.1`. Follow
[Install the packages](/gateway/clients#install-the-packages) for exact-version
commands and compatibility guidance. Package release versions are separate from
the wire protocol version and the root `openclaw` CLI release.

- [`@openclaw/gateway-protocol`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openclaw/gateway-protocol)
  publishes the schemas, validators, TypeScript types, lightweight frame and error
  helpers, and version constants. Its tarball includes the generated
  [`protocol.schema.json`](https://unpkg.com/@openclaw/gateway-protocol@2026.8.1/protocol.schema.json)
  machine-readable contract as a downloadable file, not an exported import subpath.
- [`@openclaw/gateway-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openclaw/gateway-client)
  publishes the reference Node client and a browser-safe entry at
  `@openclaw/gateway-client/browser`.

For application lifecycle guidance, see
[Building a Gateway client](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/clients). For apps
that supervise the Gateway as a child process, see
[Embedding OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/embedding).

## Transport and framing

- WebSocket, text frames, JSON payloads.
- First frame **must** be a `connect` request.
- Pre-connect frames are capped at 64 KiB (`MAX_PREAUTH_PAYLOAD_BYTES`). After
  handshake, follow `hello-ok.policy.maxPayload` and
  `hello-ok.policy.maxBufferedBytes`. With diagnostics enabled, oversized
  inbound frames and slow outbound buffers emit `payload.large` events before
  the gateway closes or drops the frame. These events carry `surface`, byte
  sizes, limits, and a safe reason code, never message bodies, attachment
  contents, raw frame bytes, tokens, cookies, or secrets.
- The Gateway offers `permessage-deflate`. Peers that negotiate it (browsers, `ws`
  clients) receive frames of 4 KiB and up compressed; smaller frames such as
  streaming deltas stay raw. Context takeover is disabled in both directions, so
  each frame compresses independently. Peers that do not offer the extension are
  unaffected. Payload limits apply to the inflated size.

Frame shapes:

- Request: `{type:"req", id, method, params, traceparent?}`
- Response: `{type:"res", id, ok, payload|error}`
- Event: `{type:"event", event, payload, seq?, stateVersion?}`

After authentication, a client may include a W3C `traceparent` string on each
request frame. The Gateway continues a valid value as a child trace context for
that request. Missing or syntactically malformed values within the
128-character field limit keep the default fresh request trace and do not fail
the RPC; longer values make the request frame invalid. The initial `connect`
request never establishes trace context for later frames. Use a separate
`traceparent` for each logical request on a long-lived connection; do not treat
the WebSocket itself as one trace.

Response errors use `{ code, message, details?, retryable?, retryAfterMs? }`.
Authenticated operator requests share a bounded queue for starting RPC handlers.
When waiting capacity is exhausted, the Gateway returns retryable `UNAVAILABLE`
before the method runs; retry within the request's budget. Started requests
complete concurrently, so responses can arrive out of order.

Ordinary UI/SDK requests may outlive a socket disconnect, but cannot start a
handler in a retiring Gateway instance. Shutdown fences new request entry and
joins pending handler loading and authorization before releasing their runtime.
Already-started methods retain their own shutdown behavior; shutdown does not
wait for every RPC to finish. Exact pending node progress and result replies
remain available during node cleanup, until transport shutdown seals entry.

Clients should branch on `code` and `details.code`; `message` remains human-readable
and can change except where a compatibility note says otherwise. Method-level
authorization failures use top-level `code: "FORBIDDEN"` with structured
missing-scope details:

- Missing scope: `{ code: "MISSING_SCOPE", missingScope, requiredScopes }`.
  `requiredScopes` is the complete known scope set for the requested operation.
  The legacy `missing scope: <scope>` message is retained for older clients.

Clients should read `details` first and use the legacy message only as a compatibility
fallback. `readMissingScopeError` and `readMissingScopeErrorDetails` are exported from
`@openclaw/gateway-protocol/gateway-error-details`; the browser-safe gateway client
re-exports them from `@openclaw/gateway-client/browser`.

The schemas are exported as `GatewayErrorDetailsSchema`,
`MissingScopeErrorDetailsSchema` from `@openclaw/gateway-protocol/schema`.
HTTP scope failures mirror the `MISSING_SCOPE` object under `error.details` and
use HTTP status `403`.

Side-effecting methods require idempotency keys (see schema).

## Gateway-controlled WebRTC Talk

`talk.client.create` accepts the additive capability `gateway-control-v1`.
OpenAI GA Realtime requires resolvable Platform API-key authentication for this
mode. Native GPT-Live retains its configured ChatGPT OAuth or Platform
API-key authentication. A successful result includes
`clientControl: { owner: "gateway" }`, a 60-second single-use Gateway broker
token in `clientSecret`, and the relative
`offerUrl: "/plugins/openai/realtime/calls"`.

The client sends only `application/sdp` to that route with the broker token. It
must not create a provider control data channel. The Gateway creates the call,
attaches the provider sideband before returning the answer SDP, and owns tool,
transcript, steering, cancellation, and close lifecycle. Clients that omit the
capability retain the existing browser session behavior. A Gateway or
configured authentication path that cannot provide the requested owner returns
`UNAVAILABLE`; it never downgrades the request to client-owned control.

Clients must close their local media peer if the Gateway connection is lost or
a `talk.event` for their current `voiceSessionId` contains
`talkEvent.type: "session.closed"`. Ignore terminal events for other calls;
a recoverable `session.error` alone is not a close notification.

## Handshake

Gateway sends a pre-connect challenge:

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "connect.challenge",
  "payload": { "nonce": "…", "ts": 1737264000000 }
}
```

Device-auth clients use the challenge `ts` as `connect.params.device.signedAt`.
For WebSocket challenges, `ts` must be a non-negative integer. Clients that
explicitly support Gateways from before `connect.challenge` existed may use local
time only when no challenge arrives; a received challenge with an absent or
malformed `ts` is invalid.

Client replies with `connect`:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "…",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 4,
    "maxProtocol": 4,
    "client": {
      "id": "cli",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "platform": "macos",
      "mode": "operator"
    },
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"],
    "caps": [],
    "commands": [],
    "permissions": {},
    "auth": { "token": "…" },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "userAgent": "openclaw-cli/1.2.3",
    "device": {
      "id": "device_fingerprint",
      "publicKey": "…",
      "signature": "…",
      "signedAt": 1737264000000,
      "nonce": "…"
    }
  }
}
```

Gateway responds with `hello-ok`:

```json
{
  "type": "res",
  "id": "…",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": {
    "type": "hello-ok",
    "protocol": 4,
    "server": { "version": "…", "connId": "…" },
    "features": { "methods": ["…"], "events": ["…"] },
    "snapshot": { "…": "…" },
    "auth": {
      "role": "operator",
      "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"]
    },
    "policy": {
      "maxPayload": 26214400,
      "maxBufferedBytes": 52428800,
      "tickIntervalMs": 15000,
      "attachments": { "maxBytes": 20971520, "maxImageBytes": 6291456 }
    }
  }
}
```

`server`, `features`, `snapshot`, `policy`, and `auth` are all required by
`HelloOkSchema` (`packages/gateway-protocol/src/schema/frames.ts`). `auth`
reports the negotiated role and the current socket's effective authorization
scopes even when no device token is issued (shape above). `deviceToken`, when
present, is the primary reusable credential for the same device and role.
`controlUiUrl` optionally advertises the Gateway's configured public Control UI
origin and base path for shareable links, independent of the client's tunnel or
development-server address. It is omitted when `gateway.publicOrigin` is unset
or the Control UI is disabled. It contains no credentials and grants no access.
`policy.attachments` is optional (older gateways omit it) and advertises
the decoded-size ceilings chat attachments face on `chat.send`, `sessions.send`,
and session-creation initial turns:

| Field           | Meaning                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxBytes`      | Largest decoded size accepted for a single attachment (`agents.defaults.mediaMaxMb`, default 20 MB) |
| `maxImageBytes` | Largest decoded size accepted for a single image: `min(maxBytes, 6 MB agent-hydration cap)`         |

Validating before send:

1. Check each file's decoded size against `maxImageBytes` for images and
   `maxBytes` for everything else.
2. Serialize the whole request and check its encoded size against
   `policy.maxPayload`. `policy.attachments` is a per-attachment ceiling, never a
   promise the frame fits: attachments travel as base64, so a 20 MB file is about
   26.7 MB on the wire and exceeds the default 25 MiB frame limit on its own.
3. Treat the server as authoritative for everything else. Accepted MIME types and
   per-message handling are deliberately not advertised because they depend on
   the entrypoint, the resolved model, and payload sniffing. The gateway can
   return a typed rejection, while text-only model runs can omit additional
   images after their offload cap and still complete the request.
4. Re-read the values on every reconnect. They are a connection-time snapshot, so
   a live `mediaMaxMb` edit reaches existing connections only after they reconnect.

`pluginSurfaceUrls` is optional and maps plugin surface names (e.g.
`canvas`) to scoped hosted URLs; it may expire, so nodes call
`node.pluginSurface.refresh` with `{ "surface": "canvas" }` for a fresh entry.
The deprecated `canvasHostUrl` / `canvasCapability` / `node.canvas.capability.refresh`
path is not supported; use plugin surfaces.
The `sessions.observer.ask` method was removed; use `sessions.companion.ask`.
The snapshot's optional `appliedConfigHash` is the resolved source-config revision
accepted by the active Gateway runtime. Clients can compare it with
`config.get.configRevisionHash` to determine whether a newer saved config still
needs a restart. `config.get.hash` remains the raw root-file revision used by
config write conflict guards.

The snapshot's optional `controlUiIdentityUrl` advertises the active Gateway's
HTTPS dashboard URL when it uses trusted-proxy or Tailscale Serve identity.
Operator clients can open this URL for personal browser sign-in instead of
forwarding shared device credentials. The URL includes the Control UI base path;
clients must use normal HTTPS trust instead of native TLS pins and must not send
native connection tokens or passwords to it. Re-read it from each authenticated
hello snapshot and discard it when that connection closes. If the managed Serve
route exits or is replaced, the Gateway closes connections that received its
identity URL with code `1012`; reconnect to discover the current route.

`openclaw.setup.verify` additionally checks the Gateway's current application and
restart state before and after its live inference probe. It returns
`{ ok: false, status: "unavailable", error }` while saved settings are not active,
restart work remains, or the verified runtime changes during the probe. Clients
should preserve the selected model and retry after application or restart finishes.
Standalone CLI verification still tests saved configuration without requiring a
running Gateway.

While the gateway is still finishing startup sidecars, `connect` can return a
retryable `UNAVAILABLE` error with `details.reason: "startup-sidecars"` and
`retryAfterMs`. Retry within your connection budget instead of treating it as
a terminal handshake failure.

When a device token is issued, `hello-ok.auth` adds it:

```json validate=false
{
  "auth": {
    "deviceToken": "…",
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read"]
  }
}
```

Built-in QR/setup-code bootstrap is a mobile handoff path. A successful
baseline setup-code connect returns a primary node token plus one bounded
operator token:

```json validate=false
{
  "auth": {
    "deviceToken": "…",
    "role": "node",
    "scopes": [],
    "deviceTokens": [
      {
        "deviceToken": "…",
        "role": "operator",
        "scopes": ["operator.approvals", "operator.read", "operator.talk.secrets", "operator.write"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This operator handoff is bounded on purpose: enough to start the mobile
operator loop and native setup, with `operator.write` satisfying Talk sessions
and `operator.talk.secrets` covering Talk config reads, but no pairing-mutation scopes
and no `operator.admin`. Broader
pairing/admin access needs a separate approved pairing or token flow. Persist
`hello-ok.auth.deviceTokens` only when bootstrap auth ran over a trusted
transport (`wss://` or loopback/local pairing).

Trusted local backend clients (`client.id: "gateway-client"`,
`client.mode: "backend"`) may omit `device` on direct loopback connections when
authenticating with the shared gateway token/password. This path is reserved
for internal control-plane RPCs (e.g. subagent session updates) and avoids
stale CLI/device pairing baselines blocking local backend work. The exception
also applies when that backend supplies a signed device identity: it does not
create a pairing record, so an unpaired identity receives no device token.
Remote, browser-origin, node, and non-backend clients follow their normal pairing
and scope-upgrade policies. Device-token authentication still validates the
existing token's role and scopes before any local-backend pairing exception.

### Worker role and closed protocol

Workers use a closed protocol through either the public
`/__openclaw__/worker` WebSocket path on the main TLS endpoint or the dedicated
loopback ingress reached through the gateway-owned, host-key-pinned SSH tunnel.
The route selects worker mode before reading frames, so it never dispatches
general auth, node events, operator RPCs, or plugin methods. Public admission
shares the main per-client pre-auth budget and authentication rate limiter; its
wire errors collapse credential and environment details to
`admission-rejected`, while trusted gateway diagnostics retain the internal
reason. A strict `connect` verifies a hash-at-rest, short-lived credential bound
to the environment, bundle hash, owner epoch, RPC-set version, expiry, and one
nullable session; it separately checks the current version and feature set.
Success returns minimal `worker-hello-ok`; feature negotiation is independent of
the general protocol version. Frames stay under 64 KiB, except a negotiated
`worker.inference.start` frame may be up to 25 MiB. The closed allowlist contains
`worker.heartbeat`, `worker.transcript.commit`, `worker.live-event`,
`worker.inference.start`, and `worker.inference.cancel`.

For an identity-audited attached run, the live turn capability can record the
credential, build, owner-epoch, and placement checks as one enforced admission
receipt. The receipt contains none of the credential, build hashes, tokens,
environment id, or session id. Worker operation rows and placement state remain
their authoritative owners; successful connection is not an action-success
receipt.

Transcript commits use owner-epoch fencing, a gateway-owned session binding,
base-leaf compare-and-swap, and durable sequence replay; the gateway generates
transcript entry and parent IDs through the normal session writer. Ownership and
expiry are rechecked on each RPC.

### Client capabilities

Operator clients may advertise optional capabilities in `connect.params.caps`:

- `tool-events`: accepts structured tool lifecycle events.
- `inline-widgets`: can render hosted inline widget tool results.

Client capabilities describe the connected client, not authorization. Agent tools may declare required capabilities; the Gateway omits those tools unless every requirement appears in the originating client's `caps`. Channel-originated runs have no Gateway client capabilities, so capability-gated tools are unavailable even when tool policy explicitly allows them.

### Node connect example

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "…",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 4,
    "maxProtocol": 4,
    "client": {
      "id": "ios-node",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "platform": "ios",
      "mode": "node"
    },
    "role": "node",
    "scopes": [],
    "caps": ["camera", "canvas", "screen", "location", "voice"],
    "commands": ["camera.snap", "canvas.navigate", "screen.record", "location.get"],
    "permissions": { "camera.capture": true, "screen.record": false },
    "auth": { "token": "…" },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "userAgent": "openclaw-ios/1.2.3",
    "device": {
      "id": "device_fingerprint",
      "publicKey": "…",
      "signature": "…",
      "signedAt": 1737264000000,
      "nonce": "…"
    }
  }
}
```

Nodes declare capability claims at connect time:

- `caps`: high-level categories such as `camera`, `canvas`, `screen`,
  `location`, `voice`, `talk`.
- `commands`: command allowlist for invoke.
- `permissions`: granular toggles (e.g. `screen.record`, `camera.capture`).

The gateway treats these as claims and enforces server-side allowlists.

## Roles and scopes

For the full operator scope model, approval-time checks, and shared-secret
semantics, see [Operator scopes](/gateway/operator-scopes).

Roles:

- `operator`: control-plane client (CLI/UI/automation).
- `node`: capability host (camera/screen/canvas/system.run).
- `worker`: cloud execution host on the dedicated, closed worker protocol.

Operator scopes (`src/gateway/operator-scopes.ts`), the full closed set:

- `operator.read`
- `operator.write`
- `operator.admin`
- `operator.approvals`
- `operator.questions`
- `operator.pairing`
- `operator.talk`
- `operator.talk.secrets`

`operator.write` continues to satisfy `operator.talk` for compatibility with
existing clients. Voice-device setup can issue the narrower Talk grant without
general Gateway write access.

`talk.config` with `includeSecrets: true` requires `operator.talk.secrets` (or
`operator.admin`). When secrets are included, read the active Talk provider
credential from `talk.resolved.config.apiKey`; `talk.providers.<id>.apiKey`
stays source-shaped and may be a SecretRef object or a redacted string.

Plugin-registered gateway RPC methods may request their own operator scope,
but these reserved core prefixes always resolve to `operator.admin`
(`src/shared/gateway-method-policy.ts`): `config.*`, `exec.approvals.*`,
`wizard.*`, `update.*`.

Method scope is only the first gate. Some slash commands reached through
`chat.send` apply stricter command-level checks: persistent `/config set` and
`/config unset` writes require `operator.admin` even for gateway clients that
already hold a lower operator scope.

`node.pair.approve` has an extra approval-time scope check on top of the base
method scope (`operator.pairing`), based on the pending request's declared
`commands` (`src/infra/node-pairing-authz.ts`):

| Declared commands                                                                                                                                        | Required scopes                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| none                                                                                                                                                     | `operator.pairing`                    |
| ordinary commands                                                                                                                                        | `operator.pairing` + `operator.write` |
| includes `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`, `browser.proxy`, `browser.proxy.upload.v1`, `fs.listDir`, or `system.execApprovals.get/set` | `operator.pairing` + `operator.admin` |

In this table, `fs.listDir` is the node command relayed through `node.invoke`.
The top-level Gateway `fs.listDir` RPC needs `operator.write` for
workspace-contained host browsing and `operator.admin` when `nodeId` is present.
Pass directory paths exactly as returned by `fs.listDir`: whitespace in directory
names, including trailing spaces, is significant.

### Caps/commands/permissions (node)

Nodes declare capability claims at connect time:

- `caps`: high-level capability categories such as `camera`, `canvas`, `screen`,
  `location`, `voice`, and `talk`.
- `commands`: command allowlist for invoke.
- `permissions`: granular toggles (e.g. `screen.record`, `camera.capture`).

The Gateway treats these as **claims** and enforces server-side allowlists.
Connected nodes can publish optional agent-visible plugin or MCP tool
descriptors with `node.pluginTools.update` after a successful connect or
reconnect. Headless node hosts restart to apply declarative MCP inventory
changes. This update method is the only publication path; plugin tool descriptors are not accepted in
`connect` params. Each descriptor must use a provider-safe tool `name` and name
a `command` in the node's current command allowlist. The Gateway trusts descriptor
metadata from the paired node, filters descriptors outside the approved command
surface, removes them when the node disconnects, and rejects operator attempts
to mutate another node's catalog. Set `gateway.nodes.pluginTools.enabled: false`
to ignore node-published descriptors.

Connected node hosts publish their complete skill replacement catalog with
`node.skills.update`. This node-role method is the only node skill publication
path; skills are not accepted in `connect` params. Each descriptor contains a
safe name, description, and bounded `SKILL.md` content. The Gateway parses that
content with the normal skills loader, includes it in agent skill snapshots
while the node is connected, and removes it on disconnect. Set
`gateway.nodes.allowSkills: false` to ignore node-published skills.

## Presence

- `system-presence` returns entries keyed by device identity, including
  `deviceId`, `roles`, and `scopes`, so UIs can show one row per device even
  when it connects as both operator and node.
- `node.list` includes optional `lastSeenAtMs` and `lastSeenReason`. Connected
  nodes report current connection time with reason `connect`; paired nodes can
  also report durable background presence via a trusted node event.

Native macOS nodes can also send authenticated `node.presence.activity` events
with bounded input idle time. The Gateway derives activity timestamps on its
own clock, exposes the freshest connected Mac through `node.list` and
`node.describe`, and broadcasts `node.presence` updates to read-scoped clients.
The app sends `{ "action": "clear" }` when the user disables activity sharing;
the Gateway clears timestamps only for that exact authenticated node connection.
Gateways that predate this acknowledged action return it as unhandled, so the Mac
node reconnects once and lets disconnect cleanup remove the old connection state.
See [Active computer presence](/nodes/presence) for selection, privacy, model
context, and notification-routing behavior.

### Node host stats

Connected CLI node hosts and the macOS app's shared node-host worker send a
resource snapshot immediately after connecting, then every 60 seconds. They call
`node.event` with `event: "node.host.stats"` and an object `payload` (or its JSON
encoding in `payloadJSON`):

```json
{
  "event": "node.host.stats",
  "payload": {
    "cpuCount": 8,
    "loadAverage": [1.25, 1.1, 0.9],
    "memoryTotalBytes": 17179869184,
    "memoryFreeBytes": 4294967296,
    "diskTotalBytes": 1000000000000,
    "diskAvailableBytes": 250000000000
  }
}
```

`cpuCount` is an integer from 1 to 4096. Optional `loadAverage` contains the
1-, 5-, and 15-minute averages, each finite and between 0 and 100000. Windows
has no load average; hosts omit the field when all three readings are zero.
Memory and disk values are non-negative integer bytes, with free or available
bytes no greater than their total. Disk fields appear together only when the
host can read capacity for the volume containing its home directory, independent
of the worker's current directory.

The Gateway accepts updates only from the current node connection and stamps
`updatedAtMs` with its own receipt time; nodes never send a timestamp. Successful
updates appear as `hostStats` in `node.list` and `node.describe` and broadcast
`node.hostStats` with `{ nodeId, hostStats }` to read-scoped operators, using
`dropIfSlow: true`. Stats are operator-facing and do not update model-visible
node context. When received, the Gateway persists the snapshot as `lastHostStats`
on the paired node record. Disconnecting or reconnecting without a new snapshot
leaves the previous value intact.
`node.list` and `node.describe` use live session stats while connected and
project the saved snapshot as `hostStats` while offline, keeping its original
`updatedAtMs` so clients can show the last-known age.

The structured `node.event` result uses `reason: "updated"`, `"stale_connection"`,
or `"invalid_payload"`. An older Gateway may return `handled: false`; the node
continues at the normal cadence without an immediate retry.

### Node background alive event

Nodes call `node.event` with `event: "node.presence.alive"` to record that a
paired node was alive during a background wake, without marking it connected:

```json
{
  "event": "node.presence.alive",
  "payloadJSON": "{\"trigger\":\"silent_push\",\"sentAtMs\":1737264000000,\"displayName\":\"Peter's iPhone\",\"version\":\"2026.4.28\",\"platform\":\"iOS 18.4.0\",\"deviceFamily\":\"iPhone\",\"modelIdentifier\":\"iPhone17,1\",\"pushTransport\":\"relay\"}"
}
```

`trigger` is a closed enum: `background`, `silent_push`, `bg_app_refresh`,
`significant_location`, `manual`, `connect`. Unknown values normalize to
`background` (`src/shared/node-presence.ts`). The event only persists for
authenticated node device sessions; device-less or unpaired sessions return
`handled: false`.

Successful gateways return a structured result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "event": "node.presence.alive",
  "handled": true,
  "reason": "persisted"
}
```

Older gateways may return only `{ "ok": true }` for `node.event`; treat that
as an acknowledged RPC, not durable presence persistence.

## Broadcast event scoping

Server-pushed broadcast events are scope-gated so pairing-scoped or node-only
sessions do not passively receive session content
(`src/gateway/server-broadcast.ts`):

- Chat, agent, and tool-result frames (streamed `agent` events, tool-result
  events) require at least `operator.read`. Sessions without it skip these
  frames entirely.
- Plugin-defined `plugin.*` broadcasts are gated to `operator.write` or
  `operator.admin` by default; explicit entries such as
  `plugin.approval.requested` / `plugin.approval.resolved` use
  `operator.approvals` instead.
- Status/transport events (`heartbeat`, `presence`, `tick`, connect/disconnect
  lifecycle) stay unrestricted so transport health is observable to every
  authenticated session.
- Unknown broadcast event families are scope-gated by default (fail-closed)
  unless a registered handler explicitly relaxes them.

Each client connection keeps its own per-client sequence number, so broadcasts
stay monotonically ordered on that socket even when different clients see
different scope-filtered subsets of the event stream.

`hello-ok.features.capabilities` advertises additive wire contracts. Native clients
send `sessionKey` in `chat.metadata` only when `session-scoped-chat-metadata` is present;
otherwise they retain the agent-only request supported by stable `v2026.7.1-2`.
That older response describes agent-wide availability, not a session's selected
profile. Retire this negotiation only when the minimum supported Gateway contract
guarantees session-scoped metadata. Method or event presence alone is insufficient.

## RPC method families

`hello-ok.features.methods` is a conservative discovery list built from
`src/gateway/server-methods-list.ts` plus loaded plugin/channel method
exports — it is not a generated dump of every method, and some methods (for
example `push.test`, `web.login.start`, `web.login.wait`, `sessions.usage`)
are intentionally excluded from discovery even though they are real, callable
methods. Treat this as feature discovery, not a full enumeration of
`src/gateway/server-methods/*.ts`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="System and identity">
    - `health` returns the cached or freshly probed gateway health snapshot.
    - `diagnostics.stability` returns the recent bounded diagnostic stability recorder: event names, counts, byte sizes, memory readings, queue/session state, channel/plugin names, session ids. No chat text, webhook bodies, tool outputs, raw request/response bodies, tokens, cookies, or secrets. Requires `operator.read`.
    - `status` returns the `/status`-style gateway summary; sensitive fields only for admin-scoped operator clients.
    - `gateway.identity.get` returns the gateway device identity used by relay and pairing flows.
    - `system-presence` returns the current presence snapshot for connected operator/node devices.
    - `system-event` appends a system event and can update/broadcast presence context.
    - `last-heartbeat` returns the latest persisted heartbeat event.
    - `set-heartbeats` toggles heartbeat processing on the gateway.
    - `gateway.restart.preflight` is a deprecated, read-only compatibility preview of restart-specific active work. It does not close admission, create a suspension lease, or provide the atomic full-work fence of `gateway.suspend.prepare`; new restart flows should call `gateway.restart.request`.
    - `gateway.suspend.prepare` creates a short cooperative-suspension lease only when tracked Gateway work is idle. While prepared, authenticated WebSocket connects remain available, but only `gateway.suspend.*` and an exact targeted non-safe `gateway.restart.request` may run; safe and untargeted restarts remain fenced. `gateway.suspend.status` checks the lease, and `gateway.suspend.resume` releases it after thaw or an aborted host operation.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Models and usage">
    - `models.list` returns the runtime-allowed model catalog. See "`models.list` views" below.
    - `usage.status` returns provider usage windows/remaining quota summaries. Clients advertising `usage-refreshing` receive an immediate `refreshing: true` placeholder on a cold cache and must refetch on a bounded schedule; other callers block for the cold provider read.
    - `usage.cost` returns aggregated cost usage summaries for a date range. Pass `agentId` for one agent, or `agentScope: "all"` to aggregate configured agents.
    - `doctor.memory.status` returns vector-memory / cached embedding readiness for the active default agent workspace. Pass `{ "probe": true }` or `{ "deep": true }` only for an explicit live embedding provider ping. Pass `{ "agentId": "agent-id" }` to scope Dreaming store stats to one agent workspace; omitting it aggregates configured Dreaming workspaces.
    - `doctor.memory.dreamDiary`, `doctor.memory.backfillDreamDiary`, `doctor.memory.resetDreamDiary`, `doctor.memory.resetGroundedShortTerm`, `doctor.memory.repairDreamingArtifacts`, and `doctor.memory.dedupeDreamDiary` accept optional `{ "agentId": "agent-id" }`; omitted, they operate on the configured default agent workspace.
    - `sessions.usage` returns per-session usage summaries. Pass `agentId` for one agent, or `agentScope: "all"` to list configured agents together.
      Both usage methods accept `mode: "specific"` with an IANA `timeZone` for DST-aware calendar-day boundaries and buckets. `utcOffset` remains supported for older clients and as a fallback when the Gateway runtime does not recognize the requested zone.
    - `sessions.usage.timeseries` returns timeseries usage for one session.
    - `sessions.usage.logs` returns usage log entries for one session.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Channels and login helpers">
    - `channels.status` returns built-in + bundled channel/plugin status summaries.
    - `channels.start` (`operator.admin`) starts one channel account runtime without re-authenticating. Params `{ channel, accountId? }`; omitted `accountId` selects the default account. Responds `{ channel, accountId, started, outcome }`, with `started` true only when the resulting runtime snapshot reports `running: true`. `outcome` carries the account lifecycle decision: `{ status: "handed-off" }`, `{ status: "retry", reason }`, or `{ status: "skipped", reason }`. The RPC is a manual override of automatic-start suppression; no `manual` parameter is accepted. This is not a provider-connectivity check; see [Per-account recovery](/cli/channels#per-account-recovery-non-destructive) for reasons and recovery guidance.
    - `channels.stop` (`operator.admin`) stops one channel account runtime without clearing auth state. Params `{ channel, accountId? }`; omitted `accountId` selects the default account. Responds `{ channel, accountId, stopped }`, with `stopped` true when the resulting runtime snapshot does not report `running: true`. Unlike `channels.logout`, it retains the account's credentials.
    - `channels.logout` logs out a specific channel/account where the channel supports it.
    - `web.login.start` starts a QR/web login flow. Params include optional `{ channel, accountId, force, timeoutMs, verbose }`. When `channel` is present, the Gateway normalizes its canonical id or alias and dispatches only to that installed channel plugin. Omitting `channel` preserves the legacy behavior of selecting the first loaded QR-capable provider. A provider may return an opaque `sessionKey` with its QR response.
    - `web.login.wait` waits for that flow to complete and starts the channel on success. Params include optional `{ channel, accountId, sessionKey, timeoutMs, currentQrDataUrl }`. Use the same `channel` as `web.login.start` and pass its returned `sessionKey` through unchanged so the provider can correlate the wait request with the QR session. Omitting `channel` retains the same legacy provider fallback as `web.login.start`.
    - `push.test` sends a test APNs push to a registered iOS node.
    - `voicewake.get` returns the stored wake-word triggers.
    - `voicewake.set` updates wake-word triggers and broadcasts the change.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plugin management">
    - `plugins.list` (`operator.read`) returns the installed plugin inventory plus locally curated official picks, diagnostics, and whether the current install mode allows mutations.
    - `plugins.search` (`operator.read`) searches installable ClawHub code-plugin and bundle-plugin families. Pass non-empty `query` and optional `limit` from 1 to 100.
    - `plugins.install` (`operator.admin`) installs either an official catalog entry with `{ source: "official", pluginId, acknowledgeInstallPolicyWarning? }` or a ClawHub package with `{ source: "clawhub", packageName, version?, acknowledgeInstallPolicyWarning? }`. When install policy returns `warn`, the error `details` include `installPolicyCode: "install_policy_warning_acknowledgement_required"`, the target, reason, and optional findings. After review, retrying the same action with `acknowledgeInstallPolicyWarning: true` approves every warning in that install invocation; each warning is freshly evaluated before installation continues. `block` and policy failures remain terminal. ClawHub installs preserve Gateway trust and integrity checks. Successful installs require a Gateway restart.
    - `plugins.setEnabled` (`operator.admin`) changes one installed plugin's enabled policy with `{ pluginId, enabled }`. The response includes the updated catalog entry, restart metadata, and any slot-selection warnings.
    - `plugins.uninstall` (`operator.admin`) removes one externally installed plugin with `{ pluginId }`: config references, the install record, and managed files. Bundled plugins cannot be uninstalled, only disabled. The response lists the removal actions and always requires a Gateway restart.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messaging and logs">
    - `send` is the direct outbound-delivery RPC for channel/account/thread-targeted sends outside the chat runner.
    - `logs.tail` returns the configured gateway file-log tail with cursor/limit and max-byte controls.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operator terminal">
    - `terminal.open` starts a host PTY for an explicit `agentId` or the default agent and returns the resolved agent, working directory, shell, and confinement state. Passing `sessionKey` binds the PTY to that exact agent session and attaches the calling connection as its first viewer; omitting it creates a connection-owned operator terminal.
    - `terminal.input` and `terminal.resize` operate on sessions owned by the calling connection and agent-owned sessions where that connection is an attached viewer. `terminal.close` kills a connection-owned session, but only detaches the calling viewer from an established agent-owned session. For a new session-bound Control UI terminal, the initiating viewer's close or disconnect discards the PTY until the browser or exact-session agent first adopts it through an authorized operation.
    - `terminal.upload` accepts one base64 file up to 16 MiB, stages it in a private 24-hour temporary directory on the session's Gateway or paired-node host, and returns the absolute path. The caller must still paste or otherwise use that path; the RPC never writes terminal input or executes a command.
    - `terminal.data` and `terminal.exit` events stream to the connection owner and attached viewers. Conversation-owned terminals remain persistent. The agent-facing `terminal` tool can list, read, resize, or close only terminals an operator opened for its exact session; it cannot open terminals. Agent input follows effective session and exec policy: `full` (YOLO) sends immediately, `guarded` and `workspace` (including accept-only or Guardian-reviewed flows) require explicit one-time approval of that exact input, and `read-only` or `deny` blocks it.
    - Connection-owned sessions whose connection drops are detached, not killed: they stay reattachable for `gateway.terminal.detachedSessionTimeoutSeconds` (default 300; `0` restores kill-on-disconnect) while recent output accumulates in a bounded server-side buffer. Established agent-owned sessions likewise survive viewer disconnect.
    - `terminal.list` returns attachable sessions. `terminal.attach` returns the replay buffer and either rebinds a connection-owned session (tmux-style take-over — a previous live owner receives `terminal.exit` with reason `detached`) or adds the connection as a viewer of an agent-owned session.
    - Every terminal method requires `operator.admin`; `gateway.terminal.enabled` is on by default and refuses every method when set to `false`. Fully sandboxed agents are refused, and an agent policy change closes existing and in-flight PTYs, detached ones included.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Talk and TTS">
    - `talk.catalog` returns the read-only Talk provider catalog for speech, streaming transcription, and realtime voice: canonical provider ids, registry aliases, labels, configured state, an optional group-level `ready` result, exposed model/voice ids, canonical modes, transports, brain strategies, and realtime audio/capability flags, without returning provider secrets or mutating global config. Current gateways set `ready` after applying runtime provider selection; treat its absence as unverified on older gateways.
    - `talk.config` returns the effective Talk config payload; `includeSecrets` requires `operator.talk.secrets` (or `operator.admin`).
    - `talk.session.create` (`operator.talk`) creates a gateway-owned Talk session for `realtime/gateway-relay`, `transcription/gateway-relay`, or `stt-tts/managed-room`. For `stt-tts/managed-room`, non-admin callers that pass `sessionKey` must also pass `spawnedBy` for scoped session-key visibility; unscoped `sessionKey` creation and `brain: "direct-tools"` require `operator.admin`.
    - `talk.session.appendAudio` appends base64 PCM input audio to gateway-owned realtime relay and transcription sessions.
    - `talk.session.cancelOutput` stops assistant audio output, primarily for VAD-gated barge-in in gateway relay sessions. Send the current `talk.event.turnId`; the result is `applied`, `stale`, or `idle`.
    - `talk.session.submitToolResult` completes a provider tool call emitted by a gateway-owned realtime relay session. The request waits for any asynchronous completion signal exposed by the provider bridge; failed submissions keep the linked run active and do not emit a successful tool-result event. Pass `options: { willContinue: true }` for interim tool output or `options: { suppressResponse: true }` when the provider bridge advertises suppression support and the result should not start another response.
    - `talk.session.steer` sends active-run voice control into a gateway-owned agent-backed Talk session: `{ sessionId, text, mode? }`, where `mode` is `status`, `steer`, `cancel`, or `followup`; omitted mode is classified from the spoken text. It selects only work bound to that logical voice call, not another call sharing the connection and agent session.
    - `talk.session.close` closes a gateway-owned relay, transcription, or managed-room session and emits terminal Talk events.
    - `talk.mode` sets/broadcasts the current Talk mode state for WebChat/Control UI clients.
    - `talk.client.create` creates or resumes a client-owned realtime provider session using `webrtc` or `provider-websocket` while the gateway owns credentials, instructions, tool policy, and the returned `voiceSessionId`. Clients pass `sessionKey` and reuse `voiceSessionId` when replacing the provider transport during one call. Clients that negotiate `gateway-control-v1` keep WebRTC media direct but move the provider control channel and tool lifecycle to the Gateway.
    - `talk.client.transcript` appends one finalized `{ role, text }` item to the normal agent session. The required `entryId` is idempotent within `voiceSessionId`; retries do not duplicate transcript messages.
    - `talk.client.close` closes the logical voice session after pending transcript writes. Closing is idempotent and may deliver a mutation-only call digest to the session's last non-WebChat channel.
    - `talk.client.toolCall` lets client-owned realtime transports forward provider tool calls to gateway policy. The first supported tool is `openclaw_agent_consult`; clients get `runId`, `agentId`, and canonical `agentSessionKey` and wait for normal chat lifecycle events before submitting the provider-specific tool result. Use the returned target for `chat.abort` and `chat.history`; keep the original key for voice-session requests. Voice-bound high-impact actions return `VOICE_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED:<id>` until a later finalized user utterance explicitly confirms that exact final execution action and the next consult supplies the `confirmationId`; policy or hook rewrites require confirmation again.
    - `talk.client.steer` sends session-scoped active-run voice control for client-owned realtime transports. The gateway resolves owned active work from `sessionKey`, without a voice call ID, and returns a structured accepted/rejected result instead of silently dropping steering. Provider-attached Gateway controls are call-scoped instead.
    - `talk.event` is the single Talk event channel for realtime, transcription, STT/TTS, managed-room, telephony, and meeting adapters.
    - `talk.speak` synthesizes speech through the active Talk speech provider.
    - `tts.status` returns TTS enabled state, active provider, fallback providers, and provider config state.
    - `tts.providers` returns the visible TTS provider inventory.
    - `tts.enable` and `tts.disable` toggle TTS prefs state.
    - `tts.setProvider` updates the preferred TTS provider.
    - `tts.convert` runs one-shot text-to-speech conversion.
    - `tts.speak` (`operator.write`) renders non-empty `text` with the configured general TTS provider chain and returns one whole clip inline as `audioBase64`, plus `provider` and optional `outputFormat`, `mimeType`, and `fileExtension` metadata. Unlike `tts.convert`, it does not return a Gateway-local path; unlike `talk.speak`, it does not require a Talk provider. Text above `tts.maxTextLength` returns `INVALID_REQUEST`; synthesis failures return `UNAVAILABLE`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secrets, config, update, and wizard">
    - `secrets.reload` re-resolves active SecretRefs and atomically publishes owner-aware runtime state. Eligible owner failures can publish as cold or stale degradation with `warningCount`; strict or unmapped failures reject the reload and preserve the active snapshot.
    - `secrets.resolve` resolves command-target secret assignments for a specific command/target set.
    - `secrets.store.list` (`operator.admin`) returns team-scoped metadata and values only for `kind: "env"` entries. `kind: "secret"` entries use a distinct result shape with no value field; there is no reveal method.
    - `secrets.store.set` and `secrets.store.delete` (`operator.admin`) create/update or soft-delete one team-scoped entry. After a successful write, the Gateway refreshes the active secrets runtime only when the name is referenced by a `store` SecretRef in the active source config.
    - `config.get` returns the current on-disk config snapshot, raw root-file `hash`, resolved `configRevisionHash`, and optional `appliedConfigHash` for the resolved revision accepted by the active Gateway runtime.
    - `config.set` writes a validated config payload.
    - `config.patch` merges a partial config update. Destructive array replacement requires the affected path in `replacePaths`; nested arrays under array entries use `[]` paths such as `agents.entries.*.skills`.
    - `config.apply` validates + replaces the full config payload.
    - `config.schema` returns the live config schema payload used by Control UI and CLI tooling: schema, `uiHints`, version, generation metadata, plugin + channel schema metadata when loadable. It includes `title` / `description` metadata from the same labels/help text as the UI, including nested object, wildcard, array-item, and `anyOf` / `oneOf` / `allOf` composition branches when matching field documentation exists.
    - `config.schema.lookup` returns a path-scoped lookup payload for one config path: normalized path, a shallow schema node, matched hint + `hintPath`, optional `reloadKind`, and immediate child summaries for UI/CLI drill-down. `reloadKind` is one of `restart`, `hot`, or `none` (`src/config/schema.ts`) and mirrors the gateway config reload planner for the requested path. Lookup schema nodes keep the user-facing docs and common validation fields (`title`, `description`, `type`, `enum`, `const`, `format`, `pattern`, numeric/string/array/object bounds, `additionalProperties`, `deprecated`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`). Child summaries expose `key`, normalized `path`, `type`, `required`, `hasChildren`, optional `reloadKind`, plus the matched `hint` / `hintPath`.
    - `update.run` runs the gateway update flow and schedules a restart only if the update succeeded; callers with a session can include `continuationMessage` so startup resumes one follow-up agent turn through the restart continuation queue. Package-manager updates and supervised git-checkout updates from the control plane use a detached managed-service handoff instead of replacing the package tree or mutating checkout/build output inside the live gateway. A started handoff returns `ok: true` with `result.reason: "managed-service-handoff-started"` and `handoff.status: "started"`. A second concurrent `update.run` handled by the same Gateway process returns `ok: false` with `result.reason: "managed-service-handoff-already-running"` and `handoff.status: "already-running"`; its continuation is not accepted, so the caller can retry after the active update completes. Standalone CLI updaters and replacement Gateway processes are outside this process-local guard. Unavailable or failed handoffs return `ok: false` with `managed-service-handoff-unavailable` or `managed-service-handoff-failed`, plus `handoff.command` when a manual shell update is required. Unavailable means OpenClaw lacks a safe supervisor boundary or durable service identity, such as `OPENCLAW_SYSTEMD_UNIT` for systemd. During a started handoff, the restart sentinel may briefly report `stats.reason: "restart-health-pending"`; the continuation is delayed until the CLI verifies the restarted gateway and writes the final `ok` sentinel.
    - `update.status` refreshes and returns the latest update restart sentinel, including the post-restart running version when available.
    - `wizard.start`, `wizard.next`, `wizard.status`, and `wizard.cancel` expose the onboarding wizard over WS RPC.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent and workspace helpers">
    - `agents.list` returns gateway-visible agent entries, including effective model/runtime metadata and optional semantic `kind` (`agent` or `system`). Entries with recorded creation provenance also include `createdVia` (`operator`, `agent`, or `claw`), nullable `creatorAgentId`, and millisecond `createdAt`; entries without provenance omit those fields. Clients advertise the `agent-kind` handshake capability to receive the complete typed roster; clients without it keep the legacy selector-safe roster without system rows. Kind-aware clients exclude `system` rows from ordinary selectors while retaining them in diagnostic views. Older v4 gateways may return rows without `kind`.
    - `agents.create`, `agents.update`, and `agents.delete` manage agent records and workspace wiring.
    - `claws.monitors` (`operator.admin`, rate-limited as a control-plane write for all phases) supports [Claw removal](/cli/claws#remove-an-installed-claw). Every request includes `binding: { configPath, statePath, cronStorePath }` for the local profile, checked against the serving owner. `{ phase: "inspect", agentId, binding }` returns at most two corroborated config-owned monitor snapshots, each with `id`, `name`, `enabled`, `agentId`, null `ownerAgentId`, `storeKey`, `declarationKey`, and `revision`. `{ phase: "quiesce", agentId, operationId, monitors, binding }` validates the current deletion journal and exact consented snapshots before cancelling scheduled work. `{ phase: "drain", agentId, operationId, binding }` also requires applied agent removal and monitor convergence. Successful quiescence or drainage returns `{ drained: true }`; incomplete drainage returns `UNAVAILABLE` after a five-second wait. The operation id must match the live journal in the serving Gateway's state; it is not standalone cleanup authority. Extra request fields are rejected.
    - `agents.files.list`, `agents.files.get`, and `agents.files.set` manage the bootstrap workspace files exposed for an agent.
    - `audit.activity.list` returns the versioned metadata-only activity ledger; `audit.run.inspect` discovers execution ids or inspects one exact execution identity context; `audit.list` remains the compatibility-safe run/tool RPC.
    - `agents.workspace.list` and `agents.workspace.get` (`operator.read`) expose read-only, paginated browsing of an agent's workspace directory for clients in the trusted operator domain described in [Operator scopes](/gateway/operator-scopes). Requests accept workspace-relative paths only; reads stay confined to the realpathed workspace root (symlink and hardlink escapes rejected), size-capped, and limited to UTF-8 text plus common image types (base64). Responses do not expose the host workspace path. There are no write operations in this namespace.
    - `transcripts.list` (`operator.read`) lists durable meeting captures newest first. Optional `limit` accepts 1–200 (default 50); `providerId` filters the source. The `sessions` result includes selectors, provider/source locators, times, active state, utterance counts, participants, summary availability, optional model/heuristic provenance, and an overview preview capped at 280 characters. Source locators expose only `providerId`, `accountId`, `guildId`, `channelId`, and `meetingUrl`, never free-form metadata.
    - `transcripts.get` (`operator.read`) accepts `selector` and optional `includeUtterances`. It returns the session and stored summary, including its canonical Markdown; requested utterances are sanitized and bounded by the capture limit of 2,000. Missing summaries omit `summary` rather than generating notes. Both transcript methods read across one trusted Gateway domain, like `agents.workspace.*`; separate domains are required for reader isolation. They do not export files or change capture state. See [Transcripts CLI](/cli/transcripts#gateway-and-control-ui-reads).
    - `tasks.list`, `tasks.get`, and `tasks.cancel` expose the gateway task ledger to SDK and operator clients. See [Task ledger RPCs](#task-ledger-rpcs) below.
    - `artifacts.list`, `artifacts.get`, and `artifacts.download` expose transcript-derived artifact summaries and downloads for an explicit `sessionKey`, `runId`, or `taskId` scope. Run and task queries resolve the owning session server-side and only return transcript media with matching provenance; unsafe or local URL sources return unsupported downloads instead of fetching server-side.
    - `environments.list` and `environments.status` (`operator.read`) remain available without cloud-worker profiles and preserve gateway-local and node environment discovery. `environments.list` also accepts an optional `runtimeId` from callers with `operator.write`. That request adds one Gateway-owned `requiredNodeCommand` result to each connected node when the runtime requires a node command. Its closed state is `invocable`, `pending-approval`, `undeclared`, or `unauthorized`; it never exposes the node's full pending declaration. Node environments include the durable `sessionHost` identity used to keep a known offline host visible, while current connected inventory is authoritative over that history. Missing identity means false. Exact bounded `{ total, available }` worker slots are live-only and omitted offline; worker-turn admission consumes a slot, while node-backed remote-exec does not. Configured profile summaries expose their bounded, canonically ordered `executionModes` array plus the existing singular `executionMode` primary/default display projection. Current clients select profiles only by membership in `executionModes`. Configured cloud workers and durable records left by earlier profiles add `worker` metadata with `providerId`, optional `leaseId`, `state`, `ageMs`, optional `idleMs`, and `attachedSessionIds`. Worker lifecycle states are `requested`, `provisioning`, `bootstrapping`, `ready`, `attached`, `idle`, `draining`, `destroying`, `destroyed`, `failed`, and `orphaned`. A connected node may also include `workerBundle: { status: "installed", version }` or `workerBundle: { status: "missing" }`. This optional observation is reconnect-scoped and reports validation of one Gateway-retained bundle; it is not launch authority. The public result never exposes the bundle hash, Gateway namespace, node filesystem path, receipt, or protocol-feature details.
    - `environments.create` (`{ profileId, idempotencyKey }`) provisions an environment from a configured plugin provider profile; retries with the same key reuse the durable operation. Direct creation without a session does not select an execution mode, so the provider uses its intentional default; Crabbox prepares `worker-turn`. `environments.destroy` (`{ environmentId }`) requests idempotent teardown of a durable worker environment. Both require `operator.admin`, are control-plane writes, and return the same environment summary shape used by status responses.
    - `worker.desktop.observe` (`{ environmentId, control? }`, `operator.admin`) starts or reuses the environment's desktop forward and returns `{ transport, wsPath, expiresAtMs, control, vncPassword? }`. `wsPath` carries a single-use 60-second token for the Gateway's desktop observer WebSocket; reconnecting requires a fresh observe call. Environments with an observable desktop advertise `worker.desktop: true` in `environments.list`. The method is advertised only when the `cloudWorkers.desktop` lab is enabled. See [Cloud workers](/gateway/cloud-workers#desktop-interactive).
    - `agent.identity.get` returns the effective assistant identity for an agent or session.
    - `agent.wait` waits for a run to finish and returns the terminal snapshot when available.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session control">
    - `sessions.list` returns the current session index, including per-row `agentRuntime` metadata when an agent runtime backend is configured. `hasActiveRun` is the authoritative aggregate direct-session activity fact. When projected, `activeRunIds` is the complete exact active set; an empty array proves the session is idle. If aggregate activity is true while the field is omitted, another runtime owner is active but its exact identities are unavailable. Snapshot omission means identities unavailable. On incremental events, omission means no change, `null` is the event-only tombstone that clears cached exact IDs to unavailable, and an array replaces the cache. Clients correlate only exact IDs they own locally or received from requests, history, or events and never select the first list entry as an owner. When cloud-worker placement is enabled or durable recovery state exists, session rows also include a closed `placement` state (`local`, `requested`, `provisioning`, `syncing`, `starting`, `active`, `draining`, `reconciling`, `reclaimed`, or `failed`) plus state-specific environment, owner-epoch, workspace, bundle, ACK-cursor, or recovery fields. Active placements may include an advisory `diskSpace` sample with `status` (`ok`, `warning`, or `critical`), `availableBytes`, `totalBytes`, and `observedAtMs`. An active paired-device placement also includes `runner: { kind: "device", status: "available" | "offline", deviceId? }`; `deviceId` names the paired device hosting the placement (the selected host for `autoDevice` dispatch), and non-device placements omit the field. This availability is process-current, derived from the exact active environment binding and reconnect-scoped node-runner proof, and starts offline after Gateway restart until that runner reconnects. Inventory changes emit `sessions.changed` so clients refresh the canonical row. Rows carry ownership projections — write-once `createdActor`, the mutable `owner` (actor plus `assignedBy`/`assignedAt`), a bounded `participants` list (owner excluded, up to 4 actors), and the full `participantCount`; actor display labels and avatars are resolved from current profiles and agent identities at read time. Pass `creatorId` to filter by immutable `createdActor.id`; pass `ownerId` to filter by the current assignable owner, falling back to `createdActor` when no owner is assigned. The complete `owners` facet is independent of pagination and remains unfiltered by either query, so clients can render the full owner picker. Authenticated callers can pass `involvingMe: true` to keep only sessions the caller owns or has prompted, evaluated against the full participant history (profile-backed human participants only).
    - `sessions.subscribe` enables session change events for the current WebSocket client and accepts the same parameters as `sessions.list` to return an initial list in the same response. Empty `{}` parameters return only the subscription acknowledgment. The subscription ends when that client disconnects. See [Session list bootstrap](/gateway/protocol#session-list-bootstrap).
    - `sessions.messages.subscribe` and `sessions.messages.unsubscribe` toggle transcript/message event subscriptions for one session. Pass `includeApprovals: true` to also receive sanitized `session.approval` lifecycle events for approvals whose persisted audience includes that exact session and whose reviewer binding authorizes the subscribing client. The subscribe response then includes a bounded pending `approvalReplay`; it is authoritative when `truncated` is false. The opt-in is per subscribe call, not sticky: re-subscribing to the same session without `includeApprovals: true` removes an existing approval subscription. In addition to normal session-read authority, this opt-in requires `operator.admin`, or `operator.approvals` on a paired device.
    - `sessions.preview` returns bounded transcript previews for specific session keys.
    - `sessions.describe` returns one gateway session row for an exact session key.
    - `sessions.github.options`, `sessions.github.publish`, `sessions.github.status`, and `sessions.github.confirm` accept optional `agentId` alongside `sessionKey`. Carry the selected session's agent through all four calls, especially for the shared key `global`, which does not identify its owner. An explicit agent must be configured and match any agent-qualified session key; malformed, unknown, or conflicting owners return `INVALID_REQUEST` before publication. Tool-originated publication remains bound to the tool caller's session and agent.
    - `sessions.resolve` resolves or canonicalizes a session target by key, raw session ID, label, Control UI short ID, or `reference: { key, slug? }`. A reference searches visible active and archived sessions: its exact canonical key wins, then an optional display-name slug is matched against UUID-backed sessions. Reference discovery retains session-list visibility rules; the separate `key` selector retains exact-key read semantics. Ambiguous references and short IDs return at most ten candidates as a successful RPC result. Set `allowMissing: true` to receive `{ ok: false }` when no session matches.
    - `sessions.create` creates a new session entry. When sandbox containment applies, local `cwd` and project paths are checked against the selected agent's canonical workspace: aliases inside it are accepted, and symlinks resolving outside it are rejected. Optional `model`, `contextWindow`, and `thinkingLevel` values persist the initial model, advertised context-window choice, and reasoning overrides atomically; optional `category` assigns the session to a custom group and registers that group when first used. `worktree: true` provisions a managed worktree; optional `worktreeBaseRef`/`worktreeName` select the base ref and branch name, and `execNode` (`operator.admin`) binds session exec to a node host. Without `worktreeName`, OpenClaw derives a readable name from the session label or generated first-message title, then falls back to a crustacean-themed name; names already occupied by another owner, local branch, or unmanaged path receive a numeric suffix. The created worktree is echoed in the result and persisted on the session row (`worktree: { id, branch, repoRoot }`). When the entry is created but its nested initial `chat.send` is rejected, the successful result includes `runStarted: false` and `runError`; clients can preserve the prompt and retry against the returned session key. A caller that passes `parentSessionKey` with `emitCommandHooks: true` should also declare the lifecycle disposition of a distinct child: `succeedsParent: true` ends the parent with `session_end`, while `false` keeps the parent active and emits only the child's `session_start`. Omitting `succeedsParent` preserves the legacy parent-rollover behavior for existing clients. The disposition requires both parent linkage and command hooks; a fork cannot succeed its parent. Main-session reset-in-place behavior is unchanged because no distinct child is created. New rows are stamped with write-once creation provenance (`createdVia`, `createdActor`, `createdAt`) from the trusted creation seam; adopting an existing key never restamps it. For human profile actors, `createdActor.label` is resolved from the current user profile when the row is projected and is never stored on the session entry, so profile renames do not drift. Session rows also carry `parentSessionKey` (navigation parent, persisted), `controlOwnerSessionKey` (runtime controller when live), `forkSource` (exact source key + transcript generation for forks), and `previousSessionId` (prior transcript generation under the same key).
    - `sessions.dispatch` moves an authorized local OpenClaw or Codex session with a live, registry-owned session managed worktree to a paired device or configured cloud profile. Pass `{ key, deviceId, agentId? }` for an explicit device, `{ key, autoDevice: true, agentId? }` for automatic paired-device selection, `{ key, profileId, machineClass?, agentId? }` for an explicit profile, or `{ key, agentId? }` to look up the managed worktree's normalized origin in `cloudWorkers.projectProfiles`. These target modes are mutually exclusive and explicit targets take precedence over project-profile lookup. Automatic selection ranks worker-slot runtimes by available slots and then device ID; runtimes without worker slots use device ID order. If a candidate becomes ineligible during dispatch, up to three ranked candidates are attempted; other errors are not retried. Explicit and automatic device dispatch require `operator.write`; explicit-profile and project-profile dispatch require `operator.admin`. A missing origin, unmatched mapping, or mapping to an unconfigured profile returns a typed `INVALID_REQUEST` without provisioning or falling back to another target. Malformed params use the write scope before schema validation. A missing cloud profile hides only cloud targets; eligible paired-device dispatch remains available. Dispatch closes local turn admission before draining active work and returns only after placement reaches `active`, with worker-child ownership for `worker-turn` or Gateway-owned harness execution for `remote-exec`. Arbitrary plain directories are not dispatchable; after admission, the workspace transport may use manifest mirroring if the managed worktree's Git metadata later becomes unavailable. SSH fallback candidates rotate only for idempotent probes, content-addressed transfers, receipt/lock-guarded artifact installation, convergent managed-worktree mirroring, and tunnel reconnects. Ambiguous unguarded stateful commands fail closed and are not replayed. Dispatch is one-way; worker-to-local pull-back is not part of this RPC.
    - `sessions.reclaim` (`operator.write`) safely stops a session placement by key. It waits for an in-flight dispatch, drains admitted work, reconciles active workspace changes, and retries pending failed-environment teardown through the placement owner. Callers never need raw environment-destroy authority.
    - `sessions.move` moves an authorized active session to the Gateway, a paired device, or a configured profile. Gateway and device targets require `operator.write`; profile targets require `operator.admin`; malformed targets use the write scope before schema validation. The caller supplies the exact observed generation, environment, and owner epoch; session authorization and those source facts are revalidated before the move commits. Ordinary moves always reconcile the source. Only a Gateway target may add `abandonSource: true`, and only when the exact source is a currently offline paired-device placement. That durable decision force-fences and destroys the remote owner, skips remote workspace reconciliation, and continues from the last Gateway-synced state without replay; unsynced files and in-flight work may be lost. Available, unknown, profile, and other-worker sources reject explicit abandonment.
    - `sessions.groups.list`, `sessions.groups.put`, `sessions.groups.rename`, and `sessions.groups.delete` manage the gateway-owned custom session group catalog (names + display order). The read-scoped list result is intentionally path-free. `sessions.groups.defaults` and `sessions.groups.update` require `operator.write` and read or replace one custom group's optional working-directory and worktree defaults. Non-admin callers can save only directories inside a configured agent workspace; other absolute Gateway paths require `operator.admin`. Membership stays on each session's `category` field; rename and delete update member sessions server-side. `sessions.groups.put` replaces only the name list and order, and rejects dropping a group that still has member sessions — delete it explicitly first. Dropping a group participates in the same member-session authorization as delete.
    - `sessions.send` sends a message into an existing session.
    - `sessions.steer` is a deprecated alias for `chat.send` with `queueMode: "interrupt"`; removal follows the protocol deprecation policy.
    - `sessions.abort` aborts active work for a session. Pass `key` plus optional `runId`, or `runId` alone for active runs the gateway can resolve to a session. Supplying `runId` keeps cancellation scoped to that run. Set `clearQueued: true` on a key-only non-global request to also discard followup and lane queues owned by that session. Existing callers that omit `clearQueued` preserve those queues. The literal `global` key keeps the existing agent-qualified `chat.abort` ownership rules and does not perform non-global followup or lane cleanup.
    - `sessions.patch` updates session metadata/overrides and reports the resolved canonical model plus effective `agentRuntime`. `contextWindow` accepts only an id advertised by the selected model's `contextWindows` array; `null` restores `contextWindowDefault`. Session organization fields and the per-session `model` override require `operator.write`; thinking, fast, verbose, trace, reasoning, and other privileged overrides require `operator.admin`. Only an admin model selection can persist as the configured agent default. Archive and restore patches require the caller-observed `sessionId` from `sessions.list` or `sessions.describe` as `expectedSessionId`; missing or changed targets fail without materializing or mutating a replacement. With `archived: true`, the Gateway protects agent main sessions (including `global` when global scope is configured) and the `unknown` sentinel; for every other real session it first fences new admission, cancels exact-session active, pending, queued, reply, embedded, and worker work, and waits for admission and runtime terminal-persistence drains before committing `archivedAt`. A cancellation, drain, or persistence failure returns retryable `UNAVAILABLE` and leaves the session unarchived. `sessions.patchMany` carries `expectedSessionId` per target, prepares archive targets in input order inside the same batch lifecycle fence, and returns ordered per-target outcomes. Spawn lineage (`spawnedBy`, `spawnedWorkspaceDir`, `spawnedCwd`, `spawnDepth`, `subagentRole`, `subagentControlScope`) is no longer publicly patchable; those facts are written once by trusted creation paths, and requests that still send them are rejected.
    - `sessions.assignOwner` (`operator.write`) reassigns the session's mutable owner to a person or configured agent (`{ key, owner: { type, id } }`). It requires an identified caller (authenticated profile or trusted agent identity), authorizes by session visibility, and records `assignedBy`/`assignedAt` on the row's `owner` field. The write-once `createdActor` and creator-anchored sharing authority are unchanged; see [Multi-user mode](/concepts/multi-user#assigning-an-owner).
    - `sessions.reset`, `sessions.delete`, and `sessions.compact` perform session maintenance.
    - `sessions.get` returns the full stored session row.
    - Chat execution still uses `chat.history`, `chat.send`, `chat.abort`, and `chat.inject`. Its `sessionInfo` uses the same aggregate `hasActiveRun` and optional complete-exact `activeRunIds` semantics as `sessions.list`. `chat.history` is display-normalized for UI clients: inline directive tags are stripped from visible text, plain-text tool-call XML payloads (`<tool_call>...</tool_call>`, `<function_call>...</function_call>`, `<tool_calls>...</tool_calls>`, `<function_calls>...</function_calls>`, and truncated tool-call blocks) and leaked ASCII/full-width model control tokens are stripped, pure silent-token assistant rows (exact `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`) are omitted, and oversized rows can be replaced with placeholders.
      Tail responses can include an opaque `deltaCursor`. Pass it back as `cursor` to `chat.history` or `chat.startup` instead of `offset` or `messageId`. A successful catch-up returns `{ kind: "delta", messages, deltaCursor, sessionInfo }`; replay each `messages` entry through the same reducer as a live `session.message` payload. `{ kind: "reset" }` means the cursor is invalid, stale, belongs to another session, crossed a reset or compaction, or is too far behind; fetch a normal tail page. Catch-up never returns a partial page or continuation: more than 200 raw events or the 1 MB payload budget resets to a tail fetch.
    - `chat.message.get` is the additive bounded full-message reader for a single visible transcript entry. Pass `sessionKey`, optional `agentId` when session selection is agent-scoped, and a transcript `messageId` previously surfaced through `chat.history`; the gateway returns the same display-normalized projection without the lightweight history truncation cap when the stored entry is still available and not oversized.
    - `chat.toolTitles` is deprecated. It validates the existing bounded request shape and returns `{ titles: {}, disabled: true }` so older clients stop requesting titles. It makes no model calls and does not access the old title cache. Current Control UI clients display descriptions supplied with tool calls automatically.
    - `chat.send` accepts one-turn `fastMode: "auto"` to use fast mode for model calls started before the auto cutoff, then start later retry, fallback, tool-result, or continuation calls without fast mode. The cutoff defaults to 60 seconds (`DEFAULT_FAST_MODE_AUTO_ON_SECONDS`) and can be configured per model with `agents.defaults.models["<provider>/<model>"].params.fastAutoOnSeconds`. A `chat.send` caller can pass one-turn `fastAutoOnSeconds` to override the cutoff for that request. Pass `queueMode` (`steer`, `followup`, `collect`, or `interrupt`) to override the stored queue mode for this request only; explicit Control UI steer actions use `queueMode: "steer"`. Interrupt mode captures and aborts the session's current admitted turn, waits for that exact owner to settle, then starts the new turn; an idle session starts normally. A steer send targets the selected session's current state: the Gateway atomically injects the message into that session's direct active run, or starts a new turn when the session is idle. Activity in descendant subagent sessions never makes the selected session busy for this decision. `expectedLeafEntryId` is an independent transcript-branch compare-and-swap for non-steer interactive sends: pass the displayed branch leaf (or deliberate `null` for an authoritative empty transcript) and the send rejects with `details.reason: "active-leaf-changed"` if another client switched transcript branches first; steer sends ignore it.

    - `chat.send`, `sessions.send`, and initial-turn `sessions.create` acknowledgments report admission separately from transcript persistence. Optional `messageSeq` is the one-based position from an actual committed user-turn receipt; it is absent while the input exists only in pending custody. `status: "started"` and `runStarted: true` alone do not establish a transcript row. Reconcile provisional input by its submission identity against accepted custody or canonical transcript identity, never a predicted position or matching content.

    - `sessions.create.fastMode` accepts `true`, `false`, or `"auto"` and persists that speed override before the initial turn starts.
    - `sessions.title.prepare` (`{ agentId, message, model?, catalogId?, incognito? }`, `operator.write`, rate-limited as a control-plane write) returns `{ title }` from the selected agent's utility model only, without creating or renaming a session; it returns `title: null` for incognito, empty, slash-command, or unavailable-utility input and never falls back to the primary model. A client passes a ready result as `sessions.create.displayName`: a presentation title stored like a generated first-message title, so it is not unique, never claims `label`, and is ignored when adopting an existing key.

  <Accordion title="Device pairing and device tokens">
    - `device.pair.list` returns pending and approved paired devices.
    - `device.pair.setupCode` creates a mobile setup code and, by default, a PNG QR data URL. It requires `operator.admin` and is intentionally omitted from advertised discovery. Current gateways include an opaque non-secret `setupId`, authoritative `expiresAtMs`, `setupCode`, optional `qrDataUrl`, `gatewayUrl`, the non-secret `auth` label, `urlSource`, and the issued `access` level (`full`, `limited`, or `node`). Older protocol-v4 gateways omit `setupId` and `expiresAtMs`, so separately shipped clients must treat those lifecycle fields as optional. The `setupId` is independent from the bootstrap credential and is not embedded in the setup code.
    - `device.pair.setupStatus` reconciles one setup credential the caller already issued (`{ setupId }`). It requires `operator.admin`, is omitted from advertised discovery, and returns either `{ completion }` after the credential-bearing response finishes or `{ deliveryUncertain }` when the bearer was retired but response delivery could not be confirmed. Both use the same non-secret payload as their corresponding events. When both fields are absent, the gateway holds no retained outcome for that `setupId`.
    - `device.pair.approve`, `device.pair.reject`, and `device.pair.remove` manage device-pairing records.
    - `device.pair.rename` assigns an operator label (`{ deviceId, label }`) that is preferred over the client-reported display name and survives device repair or re-approval.
    - `device.token.rotate` rotates a paired device token within its approved role and caller scope bounds.
    - `device.token.revoke` revokes a paired device token within its approved role and caller scope bounds.

    The setup code embeds a short-lived bootstrap credential. Clients must not
    log or persist it beyond the pairing flow.

    Pairing-scoped clients receive `device.pair.setup.completed` only after the
    exact setup handoff has delivered its credentials. Its payload is
    `{ setupId, deviceId, deviceName?, access, ts }`; it never includes the
    bootstrap credential or token-derived identifiers.

    If the response closes before delivery can be confirmed, the gateway keeps
    the bearer retired and emits `device.pair.setup.deliveryUncertain` instead
    of success. The presenting client should offer the operator a path to inspect
    or remove the paired device and generate a new setup code.

    The gateway records an uncertain outcome when it consumes the bearer, then
    promotes it to completion only after response delivery finishes. Operator
    event frames are best effort and drop for slow subscribers rather than
    closing their socket. A client that displayed a setup code must therefore
    call `device.pair.setupStatus` before presenting the code as expired.
    Outcomes are retained past the credential's own expiry.

  <Accordion title="Node pairing, invoke, and pending work">
    - `node.pair.list`, `node.pair.approve`, `node.pair.reject`, and `node.pair.remove` cover node capability approvals. `node.pair.request` and `node.pair.verify` were removed in 2026.7 together with the standalone node pairing store; pending requests are created by the Gateway during node connects.
    - `node.list` and `node.describe` return known/connected node state.
    - `node.rename` updates a paired node label.
    - `node.invoke` forwards a command to a connected node.
    - `node.invoke.result` returns the result for an invoke request.
      A node may return `NODE_NOT_READY` only when lifecycle cleanup prevented
      execution, before calling a command handler or emitting progress. The
      Gateway retries this rejection up to four times within the original invoke
      deadline, rechecking the connection, pairing, and command authorization at
      each dispatch. General `UNAVAILABLE` errors, disconnects, timeouts, and
      failures after progress are not retried.
    - `mcp.tools.call.v1` is the headless node-host command for calling a configured node-local MCP tool. It is carried through `node.invoke`, requires the node to declare the command, and remains subject to pairing approval and `gateway.nodes.commands.deny`.
    - `node.event` carries node-originated events back into the gateway.
    - `node.pluginTools.update` is the only publication path for replacing the connected node's agent-visible plugin/MCP tool descriptors; `connect` params do not carry them.
    - `node.pending.pull` and `node.pending.ack` are the connected-node queue APIs.
    - `node.pending.enqueue` and `node.pending.drain` manage durable pending work for offline/disconnected nodes.

  <Accordion title="Approval families">
    - `approval.history` returns newest-first terminal approvals retained for 30 days for exec, plugin, and system-agent requests (scope `operator.approvals`). It supports cursor pagination plus an optional kind filter; pending approvals are not history rows. Treat each cursor as an opaque server token and return the exact value without padding, rewriting, or adding fields.
    - `approval.get` and `approval.resolve` are the kind-agnostic durable approval methods (scope `operator.approvals`). `approval.get` returns a sanitized pending or retained terminal projection with a stable `urlPath`; `approval.resolve` accepts the canonical approval id, an explicit `kind`, and a decision, applies first-answer-wins resolution, and always returns the recorded canonical result.
    - `exec.approval.request`, `exec.approval.get`, `exec.approval.list`, and `exec.approval.resolve` cover one-shot exec approval requests plus pending approval lookup/replay. They are protocol-boundary adapters over the same durable approval registry.
    - `exec.approval.waitDecision` waits on one pending exec approval and returns the final decision (or `null` on timeout).
    - `exec.approvals.get` and `exec.approvals.set` manage gateway exec approval policy snapshots.
    - `exec.approvals.node.get` and `exec.approvals.node.set` manage node-local exec approval policy via node relay commands.
    - `plugin.approval.request`, `plugin.approval.list`, `plugin.approval.waitDecision`, and `plugin.approval.resolve` cover plugin-defined approval flows.

  <Accordion title="Control UI commands">
    - `ui.command` lets an `operator.write` caller send typed layout and navigation commands to connected Control UI clients that advertise the `ui-commands` capability.
    - Commands cover pane split/close/focus, sidebar visibility, terminal/browser panel visibility and dock, and session navigation.
    - Protocol v1 intentionally fans out to every connected capable Control UI. If none is connected, the request fails with `UNAVAILABLE` instead of pretending the layout changed.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automation, skills, and tools">
    - Automation: `wake` schedules an immediate or next-heartbeat wake text injection; `cron.get`, `cron.list`, `cron.status`, `cron.add`, `cron.update`, `cron.remove`, `cron.run`, `cron.runs` manage scheduled work.
    - `cron.run` remains an enqueue-style RPC for manual runs. Clients that need completion semantics should read the returned `runId` and poll `cron.runs`.
    - `cron.runs` accepts an optional non-empty `runId` filter so clients can follow one queued manual run without racing against other history entries for the same job.
    - Skills and tools: `commands.list`, `skills.*`, `tools.catalog`, `tools.effective`, `tools.invoke`. See [Operator helper methods](#operator-helper-methods) below.

### Session list bootstrap

Call `sessions.subscribe` with a non-empty `sessions.list` parameter object, such
as `{ limit: 60, ownerFirst: true }`, to subscribe and load the initial roster in
one request. A successful WebSocket response has the payload
`{ subscribed: true, list }`, where `list` is the normal `SessionsListResult`.
Calling with `{}` preserves the acknowledgment-only response
`{ subscribed: true }` and does not read a snapshot.
List parameters select the snapshot; they do not filter the connection's session
event subscription.

The Gateway registers the subscription before projecting the list. Clients must
listen for `sessions.changed` before making the request: events can arrive while
the snapshot is being built. Reconcile those events with the response and issue
a trailing `sessions.list` refresh when needed, including when an event only
invalidates the cached list. Reconnects require a new subscription and snapshot.

Both methods accept `ownerFirst: true` to prepend up to 60 matching viewer-owned
rows (or `limit`, when smaller) to the normal first page, deduplicated by session key. This applies only
when `offset` is zero or omitted; later pages use normal pagination. Owned rows
must pass the same visibility and list filters as the shared page. The Gateway
resolves the viewer from the authenticated connection; no client-supplied
identity selects these rows. Without an authenticated viewer identity, or when
`ownerFirst` is false or omitted, the list uses normal ordering.

The shared page still determines `limitApplied`, `offset`, `nextOffset`,
`hasMore`, and `totalCount`. Prepended rows can make `sessions.length` and `count`
exceed the shared page size. Use `nextOffset` to advance and deduplicate rows by
session key across pages; do not derive the next offset from the displayed row
count.

### Common event families

- `chat`: UI chat updates such as `chat.inject` and other transcript-only chat
  events. In protocol v4, delta payloads carry `deltaText`; `message` remains
  the cumulative assistant snapshot. Non-prefix replacements set
  `replace=true` and use `deltaText` as the replacement text.
  Failed runs (`state: "error"`) may include `errorDetail` alongside the coarse
  `errorKind` and human-readable `errorMessage`. This closed object has seven
  optional fields: `provider`, `model`, `failoverReason`,
  `providerRuntimeFailureKind`, `providerErrorType`, `httpStatus`, and
  `providerErrorMessagePreview`. Strings are capped at 300 characters; `httpStatus`
  is an integer from 100 through 599. Details come from the failed attempt's
  sanitized provider observation, not from reparsing the user-facing message.
  The preview is credential-redacted and may be shorter than the protocol cap.
  Raw bodies, raw previews, and diagnostic hashes are never included in
  `errorDetail`. Runs without provider observations omit it; successful and
  canceled events do not carry it. This is an additive protocol-v4 field.
- `session.message`, `session.operation`, `session.tool`: transcript, in-flight
  session operation, and event-stream updates for a subscribed session.
- `session.approval`: sanitized pending and terminal approval truth for an
  explicitly opted-in exact-session subscriber. Child approvals use the
  persisted ancestor audience; events never mutate transcripts or wake agents.
- `session.observer`: safe live session headline and status digest. A model-authored
  preamble can update the headline immediately; utility-model assessments replace
  it later when available. Web, iOS, and Android use the same run-scoped digest.
  The optional `sessionId` and opaque `lifecycleRevision` identify the session
  lifecycle; `lifecycleRevision` can be absent before the first reset. Revisions
  increase across runs within that lifecycle but can restart after a reset.
  Critical notice history starts fresh when the identity pair changes, including
  when `/clear` preserves `sessionId` and changes `lifecycleRevision`.
  Clients show its headline or inspector link only while the digest's exact `runId`
  is present in `activeRunIds`.
- `sessions.changed`: session index or metadata changed. Active-run fields use the
  same aggregate and complete-exact semantics as `sessions.list`; `activeRunIds: null`
  clears cached exact identities to unavailable, omission leaves the cache unchanged,
  and an array replaces it. Delete notifications from `sessions.delete` and incognito
  reset carry the removed generation's `sessionId`, without a current-row snapshot.
  Clients must not delete a replacement with a different ID. A key-only delete event
  or a rowless global notification invalidates the canonical session list; it does
  not identify the current generation as deleted.
- `presence`: system presence snapshot updates.
- `tick`: periodic keepalive/liveness event.
- `health`: gateway health snapshot update.
- `heartbeat`: heartbeat event stream update.
- `cron`: cron run/job change event.
- `shutdown`: gateway shutdown notification.
- `node.pair.requested` / `node.pair.resolved`: node pairing lifecycle.
- `node.invoke.request`: node invoke request broadcast.
- `device.pair.requested` / `device.pair.resolved`: paired-device approval lifecycle.
- `device.pair.setup.completed`: exact setup-code handoff completion, scoped to
  `operator.pairing`.
- `device.pair.setup.deliveryUncertain`: replay-safe setup-code retirement whose
  credential response delivery could not be confirmed, scoped to `operator.pairing`.
- `voicewake.changed`: wake-word trigger config changed.
- `config.changed`: a config write persisted (payload carries the config path,
  the new snapshot hash, and a timestamp — never config content). Operator-read
  scoped; clients refresh via `config.get`.
- `skills.changed`: connectivity, the skill catalog, config, or eligibility
  changed after the gateway invalidated its skills snapshot. The payload's
  `reason` is `watch`, `watch-targets`, `manual`, `remote-node`,
  `config-change`, or `workshop`. Operator-read scoped; clients refresh via
  `skills.status`.
- `exec.approval.requested` / `exec.approval.resolved`: exec approval
  lifecycle.
- `plugin.approval.requested` / `plugin.approval.resolved`: plugin approval
  lifecycle.

### Node helper methods

Nodes may call `skills.bins` to fetch the current list of skill executables
for auto-allow checks.

### Node exec lifecycle events

Nodes report `system.run` lifecycle through the node-role `node.event` RPC with
`event: "exec.started"`, `"exec.finished"`, or `"exec.denied"`. These are not the
operator `exec.approval.*` broadcasts and do not use the retired TCP bridge.

The RPC accepts a JSON string in `payloadJSON` or an object in `payload`. A string
`payloadJSON` takes precedence when both are supplied. For example:

```json
{
  "event": "exec.finished",
  "payload": {
    "sessionKey": "agent:main:main",
    "runId": "<exec-run-id>",
    "host": "node",
    "exitCode": 0,
    "timedOut": false,
    "success": true,
    "output": "done"
  }
}
```

Current headless nodes include `sessionKey`, `runId`, and `host: "node"`.
Additional fields are:

| Field                  | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`              | Raw or formatted command text.                               |
| `exitCode`, `timedOut` | Process completion code and timeout flag.                    |
| `success`              | Producer result flag, not the notification-gating predicate. |
| `output`               | Bounded combined stdout, stderr, and error text.             |
| `reason`               | Denial reason for `exec.denied`.                             |
| `suppressNotifyOnExit` | Suppress this invocation's system notification.              |

Echo the correlation fields forwarded with `system.run`; neither an ID nor the
payload's `host` field grants authority. The Gateway matches the authenticated
node and connection, run ID, and session key when the invocation binds one.
Unmatched events return `handled: false` with `reason: "unmatched_exec_event"` and
produce no system notification. A narrow legacy macOS-client path may match a
missing or mismatched run ID only to one unambiguous invocation on that
connection/session; new clients must send the issued run ID.

`exec.started` retains the authorization record; `exec.finished` and
`exec.denied` consume it before notification filtering. `tools.exec.notifyOnExit:
false` or `suppressNotifyOnExit: true` suppresses notifications. Denied events
never enqueue a system event or wake agent work. Finished events notify only for
timeout, nonzero or unknown exit code, or nonempty compacted output; successful
exit 0 with no output stays quiet. Finished notifications with a run ID are
deduplicated by canonical session and run ID. A heartbeat wake is requested only
after a system event is queued.

Node event delivery is best-effort, not a durable completion ledger.

## Audit ledger RPC

`audit.activity.list` gives operator clients a stable newest-first view of agent
run, tool action, inbound-message, and terminal outbound-message metadata. It requires
`operator.read`. Queries exclude records older than 30 days, and the shared
SQLite ledger is capped at 100,000 records. Expired rows are deleted during
Gateway startup, hourly maintenance, and later writes. See
[Audit history](/gateway/audit) for the data model and privacy semantics.

- Params: optional exact `agentId`, `sessionKey`, or `runId`; optional `kind`
  (`"agent_run"`, `"tool_action"`, or `"message"`); optional `status`
  (`"started"`, `"succeeded"`, `"failed"`, `"cancelled"`, `"timed_out"`,
  `"blocked"`, or `"unknown"`); optional message `direction` (`"inbound"` or
  `"outbound"`) and exact `channel`; optional inclusive `after` / `before`
  Unix-millisecond bounds; optional `limit` from `1` to `500`; and optional
  string `cursor` from the preceding page.
- Result: `{ "events": AuditActivityEventV1[], "nextCursor"?: string }`.

The named V1 result union has separate agent-run, tool-action, inbound-message,
and outbound-message schemas. The `eventType` discriminator is respectively
`agent_run`, `tool_action`, `inbound_message`, or `outbound_message`; `kind` and
message `direction` remain available for filtering and display. Every event has
integer `schemaVersion: 1`. Message identity references use the exact
`hmac-sha256:v1:<32 hex key id>:<64 hex digest>` format; a channel-sender actor
id uses the same format.

All variants require `eventType`, `schemaVersion`, `eventId`, `sequence`,
`sourceSequence`, `occurredAt`, `kind`, `action`, `status`, `actor`, and
`redaction`. Variant fields are:

| `eventType`        | Required fields                                                   | Optional fields                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_run`        | `agentId`, `runId`; `kind: "agent_run"`                           | `sessionKey`, `sessionId`, `errorCode`                                                                                          |
| `tool_action`      | `agentId`, `runId`; `kind: "tool_action"`                         | `sessionKey`, `sessionId`, `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `errorCode`                                                                |
| `inbound_message`  | `direction: "inbound"`, `channel`, `conversationKind`, `outcome`  | `agentId`, `runId`, `durationMs`, `resultCount`, identity references, `reasonCode`, `errorCode`                                 |
| `outbound_message` | `direction: "outbound"`, `channel`, `conversationKind`, `outcome` | `agentId`, `runId`, `durationMs`, `resultCount`, identity references, `reasonCode`, `deliveryKind`, `failureStage`, `errorCode` |

The closed message enums are:

- `conversationKind`: `direct`, `group`, `channel`, or `unknown`.
- Inbound `outcome`: `completed`, `skipped`, or `failed`; optional
  `reasonCode`: `duplicate`, `reply_operation_active`,
  `reply_operation_aborted`, `fast_abort`, `plugin_bound_handled`,
  `plugin_bound_unavailable`, `plugin_bound_declined`, `plugin_bound_error`,
  `before_dispatch_handled`, `acp_dispatch_completed`, `acp_dispatch_failed`,
  `acp_dispatch_empty`, or `acp_dispatch_aborted`.
- Outbound `outcome`: `sent`, `suppressed`, `failed`, or `unknown`; optional
  `reasonCode`: `cancelled_by_message_sending_hook`,
  `cancelled_by_reply_payload_sending_hook`,
  `empty_after_message_sending_hook`, `empty_after_reply_payload_sending_hook`,
  or `no_visible_payload`. An adapter that returns no platform identity is
  `unknown`, because the external side effect cannot be disproved.
- `deliveryKind`: `text`, `media`, or `other`; `failureStage`:
  `platform_send`, `queue`, or `unknown`.

Terminal fields are correlated, not independently optional:

| Variant          | Terminal mapping                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Agent run        | `started` has no `errorCode`; each non-success finished status requires its matching `run_*` code.                                                                 |
| Tool action      | `started` and succeeded have no `errorCode`; each other finished status requires its matching `tool_*` code.                                                       |
| Inbound message  | succeeded = `completed`; blocked = `skipped`; failed = `failed` plus `message_processing_failed`. `reasonCode`, when present, must belong to that terminal family. |
| Outbound message | succeeded = `sent`; blocked = `suppressed` plus `reasonCode`; failed = `failed` plus `errorCode` and `failureStage`; unknown = `unknown` plus `failureStage`.      |

Each activity event includes a stable event id, monotonic ledger sequence,
source event sequence, timestamp, actor, action, status, integer
`schemaVersion: 1`, and `redaction: "metadata_only"`. Run and tool records
require agent and run provenance and may include session provenance. Message
records may include agent and run ids, but intentionally never include
`sessionKey` or `sessionId`; the `sessionKey` query filter therefore applies to
run and tool rows only. Tool events may include tool call id and tool name.

The activity ledger returns `message.inbound.processed` and
`message.outbound.finished` records and adds
direction, channel, conversation kind,
normalized outcome, and optional delivery kind, failure stage, duration,
result count, reason code, and installation-local keyed
account/conversation/message/target pseudonyms. These pseudonyms aid
correlation but are not anonymization: the state database contains their key,
while RPC and CLI exports do not. The ledger does not store prompts, message
bodies, tool arguments, tool results, command output, or raw error text.
Run/tool `sessionKey` values remain raw correlation metadata and can embed
platform account or peer ids; message records omit session keys.

For inbound rows, `durationMs` measures core dispatch through its terminal and
`resultCount` counts finalized queued tool, block, and reply payloads. For
outbound rows, `durationMs` spans delivery ownership through acknowledgement,
dead letter, or reconciliation (including queued wait time), and `resultCount`
counts identified physical platform sends. `deliveryKind`, when present,
describes the effective payload after hooks and rendering; suppressed or
crash-ambiguous rows omit it.

Current message coverage includes accepted inbound messages that reach core
dispatch, including core duplicate/terminal outcomes. Outbound coverage writes
replay-safe queue and platform-start records to a lazy owner-native companion
and one terminal activity row per original logical reply payload that reaches
shared durable delivery; run inspection merges those sources. Chunking and
adapter fan-out are aggregated in terminal `resultCount`. Ambiguous sends reach
a terminal only after acknowledgement, dead
letter, or reconciliation. Plugin-local and direct-send paths that bypass those
shared boundaries are not yet covered. The bounded process-owned async queue is
best-effort and may drop records on saturation, terminal persistence failure,
or shutdown timeout, so this surface is not a lossless compliance archive.

Recording is on by default and controlled by
[`logging.audit.enabled`](/gateway/config-observability#audit). Message
recording is separately controlled by `logging.audit.messages` and defaults to
`"off"`. When
recording is disabled, `audit.activity.list` keeps serving records written
earlier until they expire.

`audit.run.inspect` also requires `operator.read`. Its closed request selects
exactly one `executionId` for exact inspection or one `runId` for bounded
execution discovery. One run match resolves directly; multiple matches return
an explicit `ambiguous` result with at most 50 candidates and require exact
execution selection. Decision pages contain at most 100 receipts. Execution
identity collection is separately off by default and requires
`logging.audit.executionIdentity: true` plus an enabled audit ledger after
Gateway restart. Missing best-effort evidence never proves that a run did not
occur.

For a selected run, decision receipts merge terminal outbound activity with
owner-native `queued` and `platform_started` progress. Progress is
attribution-only, lives in the lazy companion store, and is not part of the
`audit.activity.list` result schema.

The shipped `audit.list` request, result, and `AuditEvent` schemas remain
unchanged and return only agent-run and tool-action records. New operator
clients should call `audit.activity.list` when the Gateway advertises it. Older
Gateways may report either `unknown method: audit.activity.list` or, because
authorization preceded method lookup in shipped versions, `missing scope:
operator.admin` to a read-scoped request. Treat the latter as method absence
only when the method was not advertised. A client may then retry `audit.list`
only when its filters do not require message kind, direction, or channel
support.

Use [`openclaw audit`](/cli/audit) for text queries and bounded JSON exports.

## Task ledger RPCs

Operator clients inspect and cancel gateway background task records through
the task ledger RPCs (`packages/gateway-protocol/src/schema/tasks.ts`). These
return sanitized task summaries, not raw runtime state.

- `tasks.list` requires `operator.read`.
  - Params: optional `status` (`"queued"`, `"running"`, `"completed"`,
    `"failed"`, `"cancelled"`, or `"timed_out"`) or an array of those statuses,
    optional `agentId`, optional `sessionKey`, optional `limit` from `1` to
    `500`, optional string `cursor`, and optional `sortBy` (`"updatedAt"` or
    `"endedAt"`). Ordering is descending; omitted `sortBy` uses last activity.
    Use `"endedAt"` with terminal status filters when page membership must
    reflect completion order. Legacy terminal rows without a stored `endedAt`
    use their recorded terminal activity time, then creation time, as the
    canonical completion timestamp before pagination.
  - Result: `{ "tasks": TaskSummary[], "nextCursor"?: string }`.
- `tasks.get` requires `operator.read`.
  - Params: `{ "taskId": string }`.
  - Result: `{ "task": TaskSummary }`.
  - Missing task ids return the gateway not-found error shape.
- `tasks.cancel` requires `operator.write`.
  - Params: `{ "taskId": string, "reason"?: string }`.
  - Result: `{ "found": boolean, "cancelled": boolean, "reason"?: string, "task"?: TaskSummary }`.
  - `found` reports whether the ledger had a matching task. `cancelled`
    reports whether the runtime accepted or recorded cancellation.

`TaskSummary` includes `id`, `status`, and optional metadata: `kind`,
`runtime`, `title`, `agentId`, `sessionKey`, `childSessionKey`, `ownerKey`,
`runId`, `taskId`, `flowId`, `parentTaskId`, `sourceId`, timestamps, progress,
terminal summary, and sanitized error text. `agentId` identifies the agent
executing the task; `sessionKey` and `ownerKey` preserve requester and control
context.

## Operator helper methods

- `commands.list` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime command inventory for
  an agent.
  - `agentId` is optional; omit it to read the default agent workspace.
  - `scope` controls which surface the primary `name` targets: `text` returns
    the primary text command token without the leading `/`; `native` and the
    default `both` path return provider-aware native names when available.
  - `textAliases` carries exact slash aliases such as `/model` and `/m`.
  - `nativeName` carries the provider-aware native command name when one
    exists.
  - `provider` is optional and only affects native naming plus native plugin
    command availability.
  - `includeArgs=false` omits serialized argument metadata from the response.
- `tools.catalog` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime tool catalog for an
  agent. The response includes grouped tools and provenance metadata:
  - `source`: `core` or `plugin`
  - `pluginId`: plugin owner when `source="plugin"`
  - `optional`: whether a plugin tool is optional
- `tools.effective` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime-effective tool
  inventory for a session.
  - `sessionKey` is required.
  - The gateway derives trusted runtime context from the session server-side
    instead of accepting caller-supplied auth or delivery context.
  - The response is a session-scoped server-derived projection of the active
    inventory, including core, plugin, channel, and already-discovered MCP
    server tools.
  - `tools.effective` is read-only for MCP: it may project a warm session MCP
    catalog through the final tool policy, but does not create MCP runtimes,
    connect transports, or issue `tools/list`. If no matching warm catalog
    exists, the response may include a notice such as `mcp-not-yet-connected`,
    `mcp-not-yet-listed`, or `mcp-stale-catalog`.
  - Effective tool entries use `source="core"`, `source="plugin"`,
    `source="channel"`, or `source="mcp"`.
- `tools.invoke` (`operator.write`) invokes one available tool through the
  same gateway policy path as `/tools/invoke`.
  - `name` is required. `args`, `sessionKey`, `agentId`, `confirm`, and
    `idempotencyKey` are optional.
  - If both `sessionKey` and `agentId` are present, the resolved session agent
    must match `agentId`.
  - Owner-only core wrappers such as `cron`, `gateway`, and `nodes` require
    owner/admin identity (`operator.admin`) even though `tools.invoke` itself
    is `operator.write`.
  - The response is an SDK-facing envelope with `ok`, `toolName`, optional
    `output`, and typed `error` fields. Approval or policy refusals return
    `ok:false` in the payload rather than bypassing the gateway tool policy
    pipeline.
- `skills.status` (`operator.read`) fetches the visible skill inventory for an
  agent.
  - `agentId` is optional; omit it to read the default agent workspace.
  - The response includes eligibility, missing requirements, config checks,
    and sanitized install options without exposing raw secret values.
- `skills.search` and `skills.detail` (`operator.read`) return ClawHub
  discovery metadata.
- `skills.upload.begin`, `skills.upload.chunk`, and `skills.upload.commit`
  (`operator.admin`) stage a private skill archive before installing it. This
  is a separate admin upload path for trusted clients, not the normal ClawHub
  skill install flow, and is disabled by default unless
  `skills.install.allowUploadedArchives` is enabled.
  - `skills.upload.begin({ kind: "skill-archive", slug, sizeBytes, sha256?, force?, idempotencyKey? })`
    creates an upload bound to that slug and force value.
  - `skills.upload.chunk({ uploadId, offset, dataBase64 })` appends bytes at
    the exact decoded offset.
  - `skills.upload.commit({ uploadId, sha256? })` verifies the final size and
    SHA-256. Commit only finalizes the upload; it does not install the skill.
  - Uploaded skill archives are zip archives containing a `SKILL.md` root. The
    archive's internal directory name never selects the install target.
- `skills.install` (`operator.admin`) has three modes:
  - ClawHub mode: `{ source: "clawhub", slug, version?, force? }` installs a
    skill folder into the default agent workspace `skills/` directory.
  - Upload mode: `{ source: "upload", uploadId, slug, force?, sha256?, timeoutMs? }`
    installs a committed upload into the default agent workspace
    `skills/<slug>` directory. The slug and force value must match the
    original `skills.upload.begin` request. Rejected unless
    `skills.install.allowUploadedArchives` is enabled; the setting does not
    affect ClawHub installs.
  - Gateway installer mode: `{ name, installId, timeoutMs? }` runs a declared
    `metadata.openclaw.install` action on the gateway host. Older clients may
    still send `dangerouslyForceUnsafeInstall`; this field is deprecated,
    accepted only for protocol compatibility, and ignored. Use
    `security.installPolicy` for operator-owned install decisions.
- `skills.update` (`operator.admin`) has two modes:
  - ClawHub mode updates one tracked slug or all tracked ClawHub installs in
    the default agent workspace. Updates that would replace a skill directory
    whose installed files no longer match the recorded install digests are
    refused; the per-skill failure in `details.results` carries
    `code: "force_required"`. Retry with the optional `force: true` parameter
    to replace such a skill anyway.
  - Config mode patches `skills.entries.<skillKey>` values such as `enabled`,
    `apiKey`, and `env`.

### `models.list` views

`models.list` accepts an optional `view` parameter
(`src/agents/model-catalog-visibility.ts`):

- Omitted or `"default"`: if `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is configured, the
  response is the allowed catalog, including dynamically discovered models
  for `provider/*` entries. Otherwise the response is the full gateway
  catalog.
- `"configured"`: picker-sized behavior. If `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is
  configured, it still wins, including provider-scoped discovery for
  `provider/*` entries. Without an allowlist, the response uses explicit
  `models.providers.<provider>.models` entries, falling back to the full
  catalog only when no configured model rows exist.
- `"provider-config"`: source-authored `models.providers.*.models` inventory,
  independent of picker allowlists. Rows include public model capabilities and
  route-aware availability, but omit provider endpoints, auth material, and
  runtime request configuration.
- `"all"`: full gateway catalog, bypassing `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow`. Use for
  diagnostics/discovery UIs, not normal model pickers.

Two optional controls separate automatic reads from operator-requested discovery:

- `preparedOnly: true` reuses the current prepared catalog or a completed catalog for that
  runtime generation without starting provider discovery. Control UI startup and polling use
  this mode.
- `refresh: true` replaces a completed full catalog when the selected view requires discovery.
  Concurrent refreshes share one build; a failed refresh leaves the previous completed catalog
  available and returns the failure to the caller.

`preparedOnly: true` and `refresh: true` are mutually exclusive because one forbids discovery
while the other requests it.

## Exec approvals

- When an exec request needs approval, the gateway broadcasts
  `exec.approval.requested`.
- Operator clients resolve by calling `exec.approval.resolve` (requires
  `operator.approvals`).
- For `host=node`, `exec.approval.request` must include `systemRunPlan`
  (canonical `argv`/`cwd`/`rawCommand`/session metadata). Requests missing
  `systemRunPlan` are rejected.
- After approval, forwarded `node.invoke system.run` calls reuse that
  canonical `systemRunPlan` as the authoritative command/cwd/session context.
- If a caller mutates `command`, `rawCommand`, `cwd`, `agentId`, or
  `sessionKey` between prepare and the final approved `system.run` forward,
  the gateway rejects the run instead of trusting the mutated payload.

## Agent delivery fallback

- `agent` requests can include `deliver=true` to request outbound delivery.
- `bestEffortDeliver=false` (the default) keeps strict behavior: unresolved or
  internal-only delivery targets return `INVALID_REQUEST`.
- `bestEffortDeliver=true` allows fallback to session-only execution when no
  external deliverable route can be resolved (for example internal/webchat
  sessions or ambiguous multi-channel configs).
- Final `agent` results may include `result.deliveryStatus` when delivery was
  requested, using the same `sent`, `suppressed`, `partial_failed`, and
  `failed` statuses documented for
  [`openclaw agent --json --deliver`](/cli/agent#json-delivery-status).

## Versioning

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `MIN_CLIENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION`,
  `MIN_NODE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and `MIN_PROBE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` live in
  `packages/gateway-protocol/src/version.ts`.
- Clients send `minProtocol` + `maxProtocol`. Operator and UI clients must
  include the current protocol in that range; current clients and servers run
  protocol v4.
- Authenticated clients with both `role: "node"` and `client.mode: "node"`
  may use the N-1 node protocol (currently v3). Lightweight restart probes use
  the same N-1 window. Device auth, pairing, scopes, command policy, and exec
  approvals are unchanged by this compatibility window. Plugin-owned node
  capabilities and commands are withheld until the node upgrades to the current
  protocol because their hosted surfaces are not part of the N-1 contract.
- Schemas and models are generated from TypeBox definitions:
  - `pnpm protocol:gen`
  - `pnpm protocol:gen:swift`
  - `pnpm protocol:check`

### Client constants

The reference client implementation lives in `packages/gateway-client/src/`
(OpenClaw wraps it via the thin `src/gateway/client.ts` facade). These
defaults are stable across protocol v4 and are the expected baseline for
third-party clients.

| Constant                                  | Default                                               | Source                                                                                                                    |

The server advertises the effective `policy.tickIntervalMs`,
`policy.maxPayload`, `policy.maxBufferedBytes`, and `policy.attachments` in
`hello-ok`; clients should honor those values rather than the pre-handshake
defaults or hardcoded attachment sizes.

The reference client lets finite requests own their configured deadline when
every pending request has one. An `expectFinal` request without a finite
`timeoutMs`, any request with `timeoutMs: null`, or a mix of finite and
unbounded requests keeps the tick watchdog active. If inbound events and
responses remain silent past the tick-timeout threshold, the client closes the
socket with code `4000`, rejects every pending request, and reconnects. It does
not replay rejected requests after reconnecting.

## Auth

- Shared-secret gateway auth uses `connect.params.auth.token` or
  `connect.params.auth.password`, depending on the configured
  `gateway.auth.mode` (`"none" | "token" | "password" | "trusted-proxy"`).
- Identity-bearing modes such as Tailscale Serve (`gateway.auth.allowTailscale: true`)
  or non-loopback `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` satisfy the connect
  auth check from request headers instead of `connect.params.auth.*`.
- Private-ingress `gateway.auth.mode: "none"` skips shared-secret connect auth
  entirely; do not expose that mode on public/untrusted ingress.
- After pairing, the gateway issues a device token scoped to the connection
  role + approved grant, returned in `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken`. Clients should
  persist it with `hello-ok.auth.scopes` after a successful connect when the token
  is new or different from the stored token.
- `hello-ok.auth.scopes` is the current socket's live authority and matches the
  scopes enforced by RPC dispatch.
- When `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` exactly matches the token already stored for
  the same gateway, device, client, and role, preserve that record's stored scopes
  instead of replacing them with a narrower live scope set. A newly issued or
  rotated token uses `hello-ok.auth.scopes`; its approved grant matches that
  connection when it is issued.
- Reconnecting with that stored device token should also reuse the stored
  approved scope set for that token. This preserves read/probe/status access
  already granted and avoids silently collapsing reconnects to a narrower
  implicit admin-only scope.
- Client-side connect auth assembly (`selectConnectAuth` in
  `packages/gateway-client/src/client.ts`):
  - `auth.password` is orthogonal and always forwarded when set.
  - `auth.token` is populated in priority order: explicit shared token first,
    then an explicit `deviceToken`, then a stored per-device token (keyed by
    `deviceId` + `role`).
  - `auth.bootstrapToken` is sent only when none of the above resolved
    `auth.token`. A shared token or any resolved device token suppresses it.
  - Auto-promotion of a stored device token on the one-shot
    `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH` retry is gated to trusted endpoints only: loopback,
    or `wss://` with a pinned `tlsFingerprint`. Public `wss://` without pinning
    does not qualify.
- Built-in setup-code bootstrap returns the primary node
  `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` plus a bounded operator token in
  `hello-ok.auth.deviceTokens` for trusted mobile handoff. The operator token
  includes `operator.talk.secrets` for native Talk configuration reads, but
  excludes pairing-mutation scopes and `operator.admin`.
- `hello-ok.auth.deviceTokens` contains only additional bootstrap-handoff tokens.
  Do not use it as metadata for the primary `deviceToken` reconnect record.
- While a non-baseline setup-code bootstrap waits for approval,
  `PAIRING_REQUIRED` details include `recommendedNextStep: "wait_then_retry"`,
  `retryable: true`, and `pauseReconnect: false`. Keep reconnecting with the
  same bootstrap token until the request is approved or the token becomes
  invalid.
- Persist `hello-ok.auth.deviceTokens` only when the connect used bootstrap
  auth on a trusted transport such as `wss://` or loopback/local pairing.
- If a client supplies an explicit `deviceToken` or explicit `scopes`, that
  caller-requested scope set remains authoritative for the live connection and
  is reported in `hello-ok.auth.scopes`; cached token-grant scopes are only reused
  when the client is reusing the stored per-device token.
- Device tokens can be rotated/revoked via `device.token.rotate` and
  `device.token.revoke` (requires `operator.pairing`). Rotating or revoking a
  node or other non-operator role also requires `operator.admin`.
- `device.token.rotate` returns rotation metadata. It echoes the replacement
  bearer token only for same-device calls already authenticated with that
  device token, so token-only clients can persist their replacement before
  reconnecting. Shared/admin rotations do not echo the bearer token.
- Token issuance, rotation, and revocation stay bounded to the approved role
  set recorded in that device's pairing entry; token mutation cannot expand or
  target a device role that pairing approval never granted.
- For paired-device token sessions, device management is self-scoped unless
  the caller also has `operator.admin`: non-admin callers can manage only the
  operator token for their own device entry. Node and other non-operator token
  management is admin-only, even for the caller's own device.
- `device.token.rotate` and `device.token.revoke` also check the target
  operator token scope set against the caller's current session scopes.
  Non-admin callers cannot rotate or revoke a broader operator token than they
  already hold.
- Auth failures include `error.details.code` plus recovery hints:
  - `error.details.canRetryWithDeviceToken` (boolean)
  - `error.details.recommendedNextStep`: one of `retry_with_device_token`,
    `update_auth_configuration`, `update_auth_credentials`,
    `wait_then_retry`, `review_auth_configuration`
    (`packages/gateway-protocol/src/connect-error-details.ts`).
- Client behavior for `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH`:
  - Trusted clients may attempt one bounded retry with a cached per-device
    token.
  - If that retry fails, stop automatic reconnect loops and surface operator
    action guidance.
- `AUTH_SCOPE_MISMATCH` means the device token was recognized but does not
  cover the requested role/scopes. Do not present this as a bad token; prompt
  the operator to re-pair or approve the narrower/broader scope contract.

## Device identity and pairing

- Nodes should include a stable device identity (`device.id`) derived from a
  keypair fingerprint.
- Gateways issue tokens per device + role.
- Pairing approvals are required for new device IDs unless local
  auto-approval is enabled.
- Pairing auto-approval is centered on direct local loopback connects.
- OpenClaw also has a narrow backend/container-local self-connect path for
  trusted shared-secret helper flows.
- Same-host tailnet or LAN connects are still treated as remote for pairing
  and require approval.
- WS clients normally include `device` identity during `connect` (operator +
  node). The only device-less operator exceptions are explicit trust paths:
  - successful `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` operator Control UI auth.
  - direct-loopback `gateway-client` backend RPCs on the reserved internal
    helper path.
- Omitting device identity has scope consequences. When a device-less
  operator connection is allowed through an explicit trust path, OpenClaw
  still clears self-declared scopes to an empty set unless that path has a
  named scope-preservation exception. Scope-gated methods then fail with
  `missing scope`.
- The reserved direct-loopback `gateway-client` backend helper path preserves
  scopes only for internal local control-plane RPCs; custom backend IDs do
  not receive this exception.
- All connections must sign the server-provided `connect.challenge` nonce.

### Device auth migration diagnostics

For legacy clients that still use pre-challenge signing behavior, `connect`
returns `DEVICE_AUTH_*` detail codes under `error.details.code` with a stable
`error.details.reason`.

Common migration failures:

| Message                     | details.code                     | details.reason           | Meaning                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `device nonce required`     | `DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_REQUIRED`     | `device-nonce-missing`   | Client omitted `device.nonce` (or sent blank).     |
| `device nonce mismatch`     | `DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_MISMATCH`     | `device-nonce-mismatch`  | Client signed with a stale/wrong nonce.            |
| `device signature invalid`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_INVALID`  | `device-signature`       | Signature payload does not match v2 payload.       |
| `device signature expired`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_EXPIRED`  | `device-signature-stale` | Signed timestamp is outside allowed skew.          |
| `device identity mismatch`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_DEVICE_ID_MISMATCH` | `device-id-mismatch`     | `device.id` does not match public key fingerprint. |
| `device public key invalid` | `DEVICE_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY_INVALID` | `device-public-key`      | Public key format/canonicalization failed.         |

Migration target:

- Always wait for `connect.challenge`.
- Use `connect.challenge.payload.ts` as `connect.params.device.signedAt`.
- Sign the v2 payload that includes the server nonce.
- Send the same nonce in `connect.params.device.nonce`.
- Preferred signature payload is `v3`
  (`buildDeviceAuthPayloadV3` in `packages/gateway-client/src/device-auth.ts`),
  which binds `platform` and `deviceFamily` in addition to
  device/client/role/scopes/token/nonce fields.
- Legacy `v2` signatures remain accepted for compatibility, but paired-device
  metadata pinning still controls command policy on reconnect.

## TLS and pinning

- TLS is supported for WS connections (`gateway.tls` config).
- Clients may optionally pin the gateway cert fingerprint via
  `gateway.remote.tlsFingerprint` or CLI `--tls-fingerprint`.

## Scope

This protocol exposes the full gateway API: status, channels, models, chat,
agent, sessions, nodes, approvals, and more. The exact surface is defined by
the TypeBox schemas re-exported from `packages/gateway-protocol/src/schema.ts`.

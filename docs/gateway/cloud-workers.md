Cloud workers move a session's coding work onto a throwaway cloud machine while the session stays visible in the sidebar and its transcript remains owned by the Gateway. The bundled Crabbox provider boots the box, runs profile setup, and starts `openclaw connect --ephemeral`. For Gateway-source projects with warm images enabled, it prepares the committed checkout and node runtime for capture before enrolling the node. One configured Crabbox profile supports both OpenClaw `worker-turn` and Codex `remote-exec` over the same enrolled outbound-node transport. OpenClaw launches a restricted `openclaw worker` child; Codex runs its managed exec-server on the node while keeping app-server and model authentication on the Gateway.

Enrollment is environment-owned and replay-safe. The Gateway persists one setup identity before node enrollment, binds the first authenticated device identity to that exact environment, and reuses the durable device token when provisioning resumes. Initial enrollment and replay both enable worker hosting only for that node process; they do not change durable worker-host configuration. Reclaim or destroy releases the cloud lease and removes the environment-owned node pairing. If provisioning fails before returning a lease, cleanup resolves the original operation’s handle without rerunning provisioning, setup, or enrollment. The handle may refer to an operation that never created a machine; cleanup completes only after the provider confirms release or absence. Teardown waits for in-flight provider operations and heartbeat processes to settle. Crabbox's release request and cleanup observation have separate deadlines; OpenClaw reserves both before terminating a stalled stop command.

When the work is done (or the box dies), the machine is discarded. The transcript, accepted workspace changes, and placement records remain with the Gateway.

A cloud session can start from a GitHub repository URL and optional ref without a Gateway checkout. The selected node fetches the repository, pins the resolved commit, and creates the session branch. The Gateway keeps source metadata and immutable checkpoints of accepted changes, not a checked-out copy. Both OpenClaw and Codex support this flow on managed cloud nodes and paired nodes; providers with only an SSH carrier cannot prepare repository-only sessions. The node-host runtime must be current as well as the worker bundle: an older host cannot complete the required workspace drain and remains fenced. Update the paired node host or reprovision the cloud worker, then retry.

Sessions created from an existing Gateway checkout still retain their session-owned [managed-worktree mirror](/concepts/managed-worktrees). That flow preserves local and unpublished source content. Its default count of 100 is a cleanup target, not an admission cap, and its Gateway disk-space checks still apply.

A missing setup environment value, a current Crabbox CLI/backend refusal, or changed provider metadata does not prove that an earlier attempt allocated nothing. These failures remain retryable with the original operation identity. Cleanup resolves that operation's handle and retries teardown until the provider confirms release or absence; it never reruns provisioning, setup, or enrollment to discover the lease. Malformed immutable profiles still fail permanently; policy and setup rejections become permanent only after confirmed cleanup.

<Note>
Cloud workers are opt-in. Until you configure a profile, clients hide the Cloud destination and profile dispatch is unavailable. `sessions.dispatch` may still be advertised for eligible paired-device targets. The `cloudWorkers` config schema and the read-only `environments.list` and `environments.status` methods remain available for configuration and environment discovery.

## What runs where

| Concern                            | OpenClaw `worker-turn` mode                          | Codex `remote-exec` mode                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent runtime and turn loop        | Cloud box (`openclaw worker`)                        | Gateway (Codex app-server)                              |
| Command, filesystem, and HTTP work | Cloud box                                            | Cloud node, paired device, or SSH-backed provider       |
| Model inference and provider auth  | Gateway, proxied by `{provider, model}` reference    | Gateway, including ChatGPT subscription or API-key auth |
| Transcript and live session state  | Gateway, fed by the worker's replayable event stream | Gateway through the normal local harness path           |
| Workspace file state               | Changed on the box; reconciled by the Gateway        | Changed remotely; reconciled by the Gateway             |

The bundled Crabbox cloud provider advertises both `worker-turn` and `remote-exec` through its enrolled node transport, so the same cloud profile is available to both harnesses. Codex can also use an explicitly authorized paired device or a provider that retains an SSH-backed remote-execution carrier. A profile that advertises only one mode remains unavailable to the other runtime.

After Crabbox setup, the cloud node dials the Gateway's public TLS endpoint over outbound WebSocket. Worker control, Codex remote execution, and workspace transfer use authenticated node or worker channels, not a Gateway-created reverse tunnel or rsync. Crabbox itself may still require SSH reachability while its CLI runs the provider-owned setup command. Outbound internet access and setup reachability follow the selected backend's network policy; configure them in Crabbox.

OpenClaw `worker-turn` sessions can open [portals](/gateway/portals) on node-backed cloud workers, including the bundled Crabbox provider. For each proxied HTTP or WebSocket connection, the enrolled node redeems a single-use ticket over a TLS-pinned WebSocket to the Gateway and connects to the worker's selected loopback port. This preserves the existing **Control UI → Portals** experience, authentication, and live reload without opening inbound worker ports or creating an SSH tunnel. The tool is available only when the node advertises portal-stream support; older node bundles do not receive it. SSH-backed `remote-exec` placements, including Codex sessions, do not run the OpenClaw worker tool loop, so the `portal` tool does not apply there. Update an unsupported node or move the session back to the Gateway with `sessions.move` when a Gateway-hosted portal is needed.

For a loopback Gateway behind public HTTPS ingress, set `gateway.publicOrigin` to the proxy's bare origin. Node enrollment uses it as the default external pairing endpoint; `plugins.entries.device-pair.config.publicUrl` remains the pairing-specific override. Cloud dispatch refuses loopback, link-local, or unspecified Gateway addresses before allocating a machine. If either URL is behind a reverse proxy, including cloudflared, nginx, or externally managed Tailscale Serve, `gateway.trustedProxies` must include the proxy's source address (typically loopback for a same-host proxy). Otherwise, forwarded client headers cause node enrollment to fail with `proxy_attribution_required`.

The proxy must also forward `/__openclaw__/worker-bootstrap/artifacts/<sha256>` to the Gateway, alongside its public node and worker routes. A new cloud node downloads its runtime over this authenticated HTTP route before it can connect over WebSocket. Preserve the `Authorization` header; do not expose these archives through an unauthenticated static-file route.

Node and SSH workspace access and reconciliation outlive worker RPC credential expiry, so an idle session can still stop, move, or suspend safely. Both retain the existing revocation and owner-epoch checks; node transfers also retain their own ten-minute expiry and session-ownership checks.

## Requirements

- A worker provider plugin. The bundled `crabbox` plugin drives the [Crabbox](https://crabbox.sh/) CLI; Crabbox owns the supported cloud backends and their configuration. Install Crabbox 0.41.1 or newer for the operating-system user that runs the Gateway and put it on that user's `PATH`, or set `settings.binary` to its absolute path. Keeping placed workers alive also requires a release that includes `crabbox heartbeat` (added after v0.43.0). Versions through 0.43.0 can allocate fixed-ID worker leases but lack heartbeat support; OpenClaw continues operating with one warning, and the coordinator may reap a placed worker after its `idleTimeout`.
- For Crabbox AWS workers, the effective `aws.instanceProfile` must be empty. The provider checks `crabbox config show --json` before allocation, then requires `crabbox inspect --json` to report `providerMetadata.instanceProfileAttached: false` from EC2 `DescribeInstances`. Leases with an instance role or without authoritative metadata are stopped and rejected.
- A supported Node.js release and npm on the leased machine. Bare cloud images usually lack them — install them in the profile's `setup` command. The machine also needs registry access to install the runtime's dependencies for its operating system and CPU.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) on the worker's `PATH` for GitHub commands and HTTPS pushes. The sealed worker bundle includes the credential-binding launcher, not GitHub CLI. Crabbox developer images include `gh`; install it in `settings.setup` for other images.
- A repository session created with `repository: { url, ref? }`, or a live, registry-owned session managed worktree created with `worktree: true`. Repository sources require a managed node and access to the upstream Git repository. Cloud dispatch does not accept arbitrary plain directories. Manifest mirroring after Git metadata becomes unavailable does not make plain directories dispatchable.

### Crabbox provider support

Select a Crabbox backend with `settings.provider`. Use the [Crabbox provider reference](https://crabbox.sh/providers/index.html) for supported providers, authentication, sizing, snapshots, networking, and provider-specific limitations. OpenClaw does not maintain a separate backend catalog; accepting a profile does not establish that the backend can host a cloud session.

The installed Crabbox version and selected backend must support fixed-ID `warmup --lease-id`, POSIX script execution through `run --script-stdin` for setup and enrollment, lease inspection, and teardown by canonical lease ID. Never remove `--lease-id` to bypass a backend capability rejection: it prevents duplicate allocations after an interrupted dispatch. OpenClaw preserves unsupported-backend diagnostics; upgrading the CLI alone does not establish backend support. Heartbeat support keeps placed workers alive under the configured idle policy. Optional desktop and warm-image features have additional requirements described below.

Configure Crabbox for the operating-system user that runs the Gateway. Follow its [authentication guide](https://crabbox.sh/features/auth-admin.html) for coordinator access or the selected provider's guide for direct credentials. Keep credentials out of OpenClaw profile settings and command arguments, and preserve Crabbox's state directory across Gateway restarts so allocation and cleanup can resume safely.

Inspect the installed provider contract and check readiness without allocating a machine:

```bash
crabbox providers --json
crabbox providers describe <backend> --json
crabbox doctor --provider <backend> --json
```

Read-only readiness does not prove allocation, setup, enrollment, or cleanup. Verify the complete session flow before relying on a new profile; see [Verify the profile](/gateway/cloud-workers#verify-the-profile).

## Configuration

Manage profiles in the Control UI under **Settings → Connections → Cloud workers**, or edit `cloudWorkers.profiles` directly in `openclaw.json` — both write the same config keys. The settings page lists each profile's backend, class, lifetime, and idle-stop in plain language, and shows whether it is advertised to `environments.list` or waiting on a Gateway restart. With no profiles configured it explains the feature, links back to this page, and starts the add flow.

**Machine class** is required in the class-based editor. Enter a class accepted by the selected Crabbox backend and binary; the provider determines its effective sizing. Changing the backend or binary leaves the class unchanged, so verify that it is accepted before saving. To configure a classless profile, use **Settings → Advanced** and omit `settings.class`; **Edit** on an existing classless profile opens Advanced. OpenClaw then omits `--class` unless the placement supplies a class, leaving resource selection to Crabbox without claiming a default size. Explicit `null`, empty or whitespace strings, and nonstring class values are invalid.

Add a profile under `cloudWorkers.profiles` in `openclaw.json`. This Debian/Ubuntu setup example installs Node.js and GitHub CLI when missing:

```json
{
  "cloudWorkers": {
    "profiles": {
      "aws": {
        "provider": "crabbox",
        "install": "bundle",
        "suspendAfter": "45m",
        "settings": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "class": "standard",
          "ttl": "8h",
          "idleTimeout": "45m",
          "warmImage": true,
          "setup": "(test -x /usr/bin/node || (curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs)) && (command -v gh >/dev/null || (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gh))"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Profile fields:

| `install`            | Installation preference for SSH-backed providers. The bundled Crabbox provider bootstraps the node from the current Gateway's runtime artifact, then installs the worker bundle when needed, reusing a matching prepared-image archive or downloading it through the authenticated node channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `suspendAfter`       | Optional idle duration, such as `45m`, `90m`, or `2h`; minimum `1m`. Automatically suspend an idle worker using the same safe stop as manual reclaim. The next message provisions a replacement, warm when a snapshot exists. While suspended, only retained snapshot storage is billed; omit this field to keep workers running until explicitly stopped.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `settings`           | Provider-owned JSON. For crabbox: `provider` (backend), `class` (machine class), `ttl`, `idleTimeout` (Go durations), optional idempotent `setup`, optional `desktop`, and absolute `binary` path. While a session remains placed, OpenClaw heartbeats its lease at a safe fraction of `idleTimeout`; teardown stops the heartbeat before releasing the machine. `desktop: true` asks Crabbox to warm the lease with its browser and loopback RFB desktop before node enrollment.                                              |
| `settings.warmImage` | Optional. Captures a prepared project and node runtime before enrollment, then starts later workers for that project and profile from the image. Enabled by default when a configured or placement class is known and `setupEnv` is empty or omitted; set `true` or `false` explicitly to override. Pair it with `suspendAfter` so suspended sessions can wake warm. Images incur provider snapshot storage charges. See [Warm images](/gateway/cloud-workers#warm-images) for capture boundaries, refresh, and prerequisites. |

### Warm images

Use [Crabbox 0.49.1](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox/releases/tag/v0.49.1) or newer for coordinator-backed warm images. Older binaries can complete a cold start but reject a later `checkpoint fork --lease-id`; update the binary used by the Gateway before starting the profile. Keep the fixed lease ID: it prevents duplicate allocations when dispatch is retried.

Warm images are on by default when a class is known from `settings.class` or the placement's `machineClass`, unless the profile declares a nonempty `setupEnv`. With no effective class and no explicit `warmImage`, provisioning stays cold without requiring `warmImage: false`. Placement overrides are resolved before choosing this default.

Forwarded host environment values reach setup, so whatever setup derives from them could persist in a shared image. Profiles with nonempty `setupEnv` capture only when you explicitly set `settings.warmImage: true`, after checking that setup leaves no credential on disk. Explicit `true` requires a known configured or placement class before any provider command. Explicit `false` always keeps provisioning cold, for example when snapshot storage charges or provider-side retention of repository content are unwanted.

For a Gateway worktree project with a Git commit, capture happens during provisioning, before node enrollment. After profile setup, OpenClaw prepares a pristine checkout of the admitted commit, installs the verified node runtime, and captures the machine when an image is needed. The first dispatch includes that work; subsequent sessions can reuse the image without waiting for the first session to stop. Session edits, eligible untracked files, and node enrollment credentials arrive only after capture. Repository-only sessions have no Gateway project checkout to prepare; they use machine/runtime image reuse and node Git seeds, with image capture at an eligible enrolled worker's teardown.

Project images also retain one verified compressed worker archive in the installed runtime package, outside node identity and session state. A matching new node uses those bytes instead of downloading the worker archive again. It still enrolls normally and extracts and validates its own installation. OpenClaw worker turns prewarm the worker runtime on capable nodes; Codex remote execution skips that unused startup. If the Gateway requests a different archive, the node uses the normal authenticated download; a present but corrupt or unsafe prepared archive fails installation visibly. Preparing a replacement archive removes the superseded published archive before capture. The slim node runtime archive does not include the standalone worker payload.

Daytona requires a stopped source for filesystem snapshots. OpenClaw allows Crabbox to stop the scrubbed worker for capture. A successful capture waits for snapshot completion and restores a previously running source before project enrollment continues.

Image reuse is keyed by the backend, setup command, sorted `setupEnv` variable names (not their values), desktop setting, exact effective machine class, and project identity when present. Project identity comes from the Gateway's namespace and the canonical shared Git directory. Linked session worktrees from the same repository share it; a new session or commit does not create another project identity. Separate repository clones have separate identities. Each prepared seed also records its exact commit, so a changed commit can refresh the same project's image.

Before its first provider allocation command, OpenClaw records whether the lease starts cold or from a specific checkpoint, along with its resolved class. Retries and Gateway restart reuse that exact choice; a lost response cannot switch a cold allocation to a newly available image or select a different checkpoint. The record advances through preparation and enrollment, and a selected checkpoint remains protected from deletion until the provider confirms the lease has stopped. A failed fork reports an error instead of silently changing the recorded allocation.

Warm images work on `machine0` through Crabbox's `--strategy image`; other backends keep their native checkpoint strategy. OpenClaw uses Crabbox's verified fork-readiness result for backend-specific image states, including Machine0's `ACTIVE` state. Project images refresh during preparation when the requested commit changes or the image is at least 24 hours old. Non-project images refresh at the next eligible worker stop after 24 hours. The previous image remains recorded and usable throughout capture. OpenClaw atomically records the replacement and its predecessor's deletion obligation in the same profile record. It deletes the predecessor once no allocation still needs it. Failed deletion warns, survives Gateway restart and warm reuse, and retries during periodic maintenance, later capture maintenance, or warm-image-enabled worker teardown. Further refreshes for that profile wait for deletion to succeed; replacement forks and lease teardown continue.

Allocation choice does not retry retained deletions or wait for them, including deletions for other profiles. It can select a usable replacement while its predecessor awaits deletion. If the current image itself is retiring, a new allocation selects cold provisioning. Ordinary expiry and missing-image cleanup can still run during allocation; retained deletion retries share a one-minute maintenance budget during capture, teardown, or periodic maintenance.

OpenClaw deletes unused, unpinned images after 14 days and reclaims the least recently used eligible image before admitting a 129th profile record. Provider deletion must succeed before its ownership record is removed. Pending captures, retirements, and outstanding allocations retain their slots; retirement also waits for allocations using that checkpoint to stop. If all 128 slots are retained, new warm-image allocations fail with cleanup guidance. Each profile record admits at most 256 outstanding allocations and owns at most its current image plus one capture or predecessor retirement. Capacity never evicts a retry choice or cleanup obligation.

While Crabbox remains enabled with a configured worker profile, the Gateway's existing maintenance loop also checks unused images about once a minute, even when no workers remain. Cleanup runs independently of allocation, retries retained deletions, and does not extend an image's last-used time. Gateway shutdown and plugin reload cancel and drain an active cleanup command before its owner stops. This uses the standard Crabbox CLI's shared configured checkpoint catalog. If profiles resolve to different CLI executables, maintenance warns and retains the records instead of choosing a catalog. Automatic cleanup does not reactivate removed or disabled providers, and does not cover custom wrappers that redirect the CLI's catalog.

Before capture, OpenClaw removes per-lease worker identities, device tokens, and session state, including node-host workspaces and SSH-transport workspaces under `~/.openclaw-worker/workspaces`. Machine-level caches intentionally survive: npm caches, content-addressed node runtime and worker bundle installs under `~/.openclaw-worker`, and pristine Git seeds under `~/.openclaw-worker/git-seeds`. Project preparation supplies only immutable Git content; the new session receives its own workspace and current file overlay after enrollment. Images also retain whatever `settings.setup` wrote elsewhere, so keep setup credential-free and enable reuse only for mutually trusted workloads.

Scrubbing has a three-minute timeout. Checkpoint creation requests `--wait` so Crabbox can follow the exact pending capture through provider recovery and availability before enrollment. The whole command still has a separate three-minute timeout, extended to ten minutes on `machine0` because capture stops and restores the source. These limits include submission and waiting; they do not grant another capture attempt. Provisioning and teardown deadlines cover their provider-owned phases. Scrub failure releases only its own capture reservation. Once creation starts, failure, timeout, or unusable output leaves its outcome uncertain: the profile stays paused until explicit recovery. An unresolved project capture prevents node enrollment on that source, so fresh node credentials cannot enter a capture that may still be running. Lease cleanup still runs, and a retained usable image can serve new allocations. Capture needs a Crabbox CLI and backend that support fixed-ID checkpoint forks. Continuing a coordinator-retained `checkpoint_pending` response requires the CLI repair in [Crabbox #1698](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox/pull/1698); older binaries can accept `--wait` and still fail on that response. Correct missing capabilities or permissions before recovering an uncertain capture.

A warm start provisions a fresh lease with fresh node enrollment. Cold allocations and snapshot forks use the same configured lease lifetime, idle timeout, desktop setting, and public networking without Tailscale. A warm start reuses machine-level caches, not a per-session snapshot or a suspended process.

Project preparation checks for the exact pristine seed before building or uploading a Git pack. After enrollment, workspace synchronization copies only the seed's Git objects into a fresh repository, recreates its Git metadata, and applies the current session's eligible file manifest. A matching seed skips both an origin fetch and a full Git pack download, including for private or unpublished commits. A missing seed uses the Gateway pack; an invalid prepared seed fails visibly. Workspaces without a prepared project keep the eligible origin/seed path. The Gateway builds transfer packs only on demand, and each transfer retains its original base commit even if local commits change later.

#### Recover a paused capture

Inspect local ownership without contacting the cloud:

```bash
openclaw crabbox warm-images --json
```

The bounded status includes checkpoint IDs, project keys, allocation choices and phases, capture selectors, source lease IDs, backend names, and timestamps; it does not include setup commands or environment values. Doctor reports pending captures and retirements but never clears them through `doctor --fix`. A capture older than 20 minutes produces a warning, not permission to take over. The same reservation remains authoritative across restarts; older empty reservation markers also require explicit recovery. If inspection asks for a migration, follow [Upgrade warm-image state](/gateway/cloud-workers#upgrade-warm-image-state) first.

Before recovery, stop the owning Gateway, any original capture processes, and the recovered worker. Use the source lease and capture time to reconcile the uncertain operation in Crabbox's checkpoint catalog, and resolve any untracked provider artifact. Only after those steps, copy the exact capture selector from status:

```bash
openclaw crabbox warm-images --recover <capture-selector> --acknowledge-provider-cleanup
```

The acknowledgement attests that the original capture and worker are stopped and untracked artifacts are resolved; elapsed time alone does not establish those facts. Recovery clears only that capture reservation, preserves known checkpoint references and allocation choices, and rejects a replaced selector. It does not stop processes, run provider commands, delete snapshots, or allocate a worker. Restart the Gateway afterward; the next eligible worker can capture again. Failed checkpoint retirements retry during later capture maintenance or warm-image-enabled worker teardown after provider deletion errors are resolved; they do not use capture recovery.

#### Upgrade warm-image state

Warm profiles use a version-2 envelope in the existing `warm-images` plugin-state namespace; the SQLite schema version does not change. Stop the owning Gateway and original capture processes, then run:

```bash
openclaw doctor --fix
```

Doctor performs this migration under the Gateway's exclusive maintenance lock. It preserves legacy image metadata, capture selectors, and retirement obligations, but does not invent allocation choices. Older empty capture markers become explicitly uncertain captures with their original recovery selector. Unsupported records stay unchanged and produce a warning. Runtime provisioning requires the canonical envelope; it does not silently convert old rows.

Older `warm-leases` rows record an enrolled class but cannot establish whether a lease originally started cold or from a checkpoint. These rows block new warm-image allocations until resolved. Doctor reports their count and exact recovery commands. Resolve each lease through its original Gateway or provider, stop its worker and owning processes, and reconcile provider artifacts before using the reported selector:

```bash
openclaw crabbox warm-images --recover <legacy-allocation-selector> --acknowledge-provider-cleanup
openclaw doctor --fix
```

This recovery deletes only the unchanged legacy row matching that selector. It does not establish provider absence or clean up a machine for you. Keep the row when cleanup is uncertain. Checkpoints already forgotten by older code are not rediscovered; reconcile those manually through Crabbox. Do not run older and newer writers against the same state or downgrade while allocations, captures, or retirements remain unresolved.

### Per-project default profiles

Use `cloudWorkers.projectProfiles` to select a default profile from a managed session worktree's `origin` remote. Keys use the normalized lowercase repository identity `host/owner/repo`, without a trailing `.git`:

```json5 validate=false
{
  cloudWorkers: {
    projectProfiles: {
      "github.com/acme/app": "aws",
    },
  },
}
```

An explicit `profileId` or `deviceId` in `sessions.dispatch` always wins. A target-less project-profile lookup requires `operator.admin`. Deleting a profile from the Cloud workers settings also removes project defaults that reference it. If a manually configured mapping names a profile that is not present in `cloudWorkers.profiles`, dispatch fails closed and names both the repository key and missing profile. A worktree with no `origin` or no matching mapping returns a typed `INVALID_REQUEST` without provisioning or falling back to another target.

The enrolled node stores its identity, durable device token, endpoint, worker bundles, and workspaces under an isolated per-lease state directory on the disposable box. Provision replay first adopts the fixed Crabbox lease, then either resumes that node state or reuses the still-pending setup credential. It never mints a second environment identity for the same operation.

OpenClaw derives one canonical `cbx_...` lease ID from the durable provision operation and passes it to `crabbox warmup --lease-id`; the deterministic slug is display metadata only. If warmup commits but its response is lost, Gateway reconciliation repeats the same fixed-ID operation and Crabbox returns or adopts only the exactly attested lease. Intent drift, terminal ID reuse, and ambiguous unverified resources fail closed without allocating a replacement.

A Gateway restart that interrupts pending provisioning leaves the placement in `provisioning` and resumes the same environment and provider operation after startup. Explicit **Stop cloud worker…** still requests destruction and prevents replay.

An interrupted legacy dispatch may have allocated a random lease without recording its ID. OpenClaw cannot identify that allocation safely from the old operation alone. It refuses replay and slug adoption, retaining the unresolved allocation and cleanup record across restarts instead of treating the resource as gone. Identify and clean up any prior lease before starting a new dispatch; do not guess by slug. Automatic identification or settlement of the old record is not supported. Legacy records already marked failed are not reopened automatically.

### The setup command

`settings.setup` runs on the leased box after Crabbox reports it ready and before ephemeral node enrollment. It runs on **every** provision attempt, including replay after an interrupted dispatch, so it must be idempotent — guard installs with a `command -v`/`test -x` check as in the example. At minimum, the resulting machine needs a supported Node.js release and npm. If setup or enrollment fails, the provider stops the lease and the dispatch fails closed; no half-configured paid box is hidden behind terminal state.

The example profile supports both OpenClaw and Codex. Keep setup focused on machine prerequisites and project tools. You do not need to install OpenClaw globally, append a versioned Codex plugin install, or maintain a package URL in the profile. Remove those old runtime-install steps when updating an existing profile; bootstrap supplies the running Gateway's runtime automatically.

### Bundle installation

Before enrolling a cloud node, the Gateway prepares a reusable runtime archive from its current built installation in a temporary staging directory. This works for published packages and source checkouts. It includes the complete node host and the trusted plugins that own the registered remote-execution commands required by the selected execution mode. Codex's plugin and its native dependency pin therefore travel with the node distribution without a separate profile recipe.

The archive is selected and verified by SHA-256 content digest, not by the OpenClaw version string or Git commit alone. Two source builds with the same version can produce different archives, including a build containing uncommitted changes. Build source changes with `pnpm build` and restart the Gateway before dispatching. Bootstrap does not compile an unbuilt checkout, copy raw edits over a running build, or rewrite the running Gateway's installation. Missing or mismatched build metadata produces an actionable rebuild-and-restart error.

Each enrollment receives short-lived download authority scoped to that live provisioning operation. Project image preparation first receives a runtime-only artifact grant: it installs the verified runtime without minting a node identity or enrollment credential. That grant closes before enrollment starts, and closing the provisioning operation revokes it. The node verifies the archive's declared size and digest, installs it as the node user, and enables its required plugins in isolated per-lease state only during enrollment. The archive contains runtime code and package metadata, not the Gateway's config, auth profiles, session state, or process environment. Download and enrollment credentials are not passed to npm or the launched node process.

Native dependencies are installed by npm for the cloud machine's operating system and CPU; the archive does not copy the build host's native `node_modules`. Registry access is still required, and this is not an offline dependency bundle. Bootstrap does not select a global OpenClaw installation merely because its version matches.

Bootstrap emits `CRABBOX_PHASE:openclaw-bootstrap-*` markers into the Crabbox command stream for download, installation, verification, plugin activation, and node launch. Crabbox records these as command phase timings; cached runs emit only the work they perform.

The Gateway reuses its prepared archive for subsequent enrollments with the same execution mode. Nodes keep successful installs under `~/.openclaw-worker/node-runtimes/<sha256>`, so a warm image can reuse the exact artifact. A different digest selects a different installation even when the version is unchanged. The runtime archive omits worker deploy artifacts and the Gateway's Control UI assets, reducing transfer and installation work. The Gateway continues to serve the dashboard. After enrollment, OpenClaw `worker-turn` installs the content-addressed worker bundle from a matching archive retained in a prepared project image, or downloads it through the authenticated node channel when that archive is absent. Prepared archives still undergo validation; see [Warm images](/gateway/cloud-workers#warm-images). Codex `remote-exec` starts the managed exec-server directly. Existing placement checks, node-command allowlists, and invocation approval still govern execution.

### Build a complete custom node package

Automatic cloud bootstrap does not require a manually published package. For a separate deployment or package-validation workflow, the canonical package builder can still produce a complete custom distribution and explicitly include source-owned plugins that the ordinary core package excludes:

```bash
source_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
node scripts/package-openclaw-for-docker.mjs \
  --bundle-plugin codex \
  --pnpm-pack \
  --allow-unreleased-changelog \
  --output-dir .artifacts/cloud-node \
  --output-name "openclaw-cloud-${source_sha}.tgz"
shasum -a 256 ".artifacts/cloud-node/openclaw-cloud-${source_sha}.tgz"
```

Run this in a clean, trusted checkout with dependencies installed. The builder compiles the runtime, includes the selected plugin's built entrypoints and import closure, and regenerates the installation inventory. It temporarily adds the plugin's exact runtime dependency pins to the distribution manifest, rejecting conflicting or unpinned dependencies, then restores the source manifest and inventory. Repeat `--bundle-plugin <id>` for additional source plugins. Without that option, the ordinary core package and external plugin publication contracts are unchanged.

Deliver the resulting archive through your existing immutable artifact path and verify its SHA-256 before installing it with normal npm lifecycle scripts enabled. Record both source SHA and archive digest: different unreleased builds can share a version. Do not copy a plugin into an installed release or substitute a standalone `npm-pack:` plugin archive for this distribution. Cloud profiles do not consume this URL; their enrollment artifact comes from the running Gateway.

After verifying the downloaded archive, install it with the mask scoped to the root command, then verify the version as the user who will run it:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'umask 022 && npm install -g /tmp/openclaw-cloud.tgz'
openclaw --version
```

Use the path of your verified archive in place of `/tmp/openclaw-cloud.tgz`. Changing the install mask does not repair existing root-only parent directories; if an earlier install was inaccessible, correct access to that package and its parent directories before retrying enrollment.

Native dependencies are declared at the distribution root and installed for the target operating system and CPU; the archive does not copy the build host's plugin `node_modules`. Target installation still needs registry access and is not an offline dependency bundle. Verify each target architecture you deploy. Use `--skip-build` only when reusing a complete build from that same source revision with all selected plugin outputs present.

### Verify the profile

Validate before restarting the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw config validate --json
openclaw plugins inspect crabbox --runtime --json
```

Changes under `cloudWorkers.profiles` require a Gateway restart. The default `gateway.reload.mode: "hybrid"` watches the config and performs that restart automatically; with reload watching disabled, run `openclaw gateway restart`.

To use the same profile with Codex, enable a trusted Codex plugin installation on the Gateway and explicitly add `codex.exec-server.stdio.v1` to `gateway.nodes.commands.allow`. Bootstrap includes and enables the required plugin in the cloud node's isolated state automatically. Installing the runtime does not grant execution authority: persistent command enablement does not replace the critical launch approval. **Allow once** covers one exec-server launch; **Allow always** covers later launches only while the exact placement, node pairing, environment owner, command approval scope, and workspace stay current.

After the Gateway is back, prove the profile is advertised and compare it with Crabbox's read-only lease inventory:

```bash
openclaw gateway call environments.list --params '{}'
crabbox list --provider aws --json
```

The `environments.list` response must include the configured id under `profiles`. `crabbox list` is non-mutating. By contrast, `crabbox warmup` provisions a lease, and `crabbox stop` or `crabbox release` tears one down; use those mutating commands only when you intend to create or destroy cloud resources.

Before relying on a new profile, authorize provider spend and test allocation, setup, node enrollment, a turn in the selected runtime, and a workspace edit reconciled back to the Gateway. Test cancellation and interrupted-dispatch replay against the same lease, then stop the session and verify teardown using Crabbox's provider-specific cleanup contract. Read-only readiness checks and mocked tests are not substitutes for this end-to-end verification.

## Dispatching a session

Administrators can run an authorized repository or managed-worktree session on a configured cloud profile. Session ownership and participation checks are revalidated before placement lifecycle changes commit.

In the Control UI, open **New Session** and use the unified **Place** picker to choose both the working folder and a **Cloud · profile** destination. A cloud destination appears only when all four eligibility gates pass:

1. The connected operator has `operator.admin` scope.
2. `environments.list` advertises at least one configured profile.
3. A GitHub repository is selected, or the selected Gateway folder is a Git checkout that can use a managed worktree.
4. The selected agent runtime advertises cloud placement support.

With a GitHub repository selected, **Remote checkout** lets you choose the source ref without cloning on the Gateway. With a Gateway folder selected, cloud selection enables its managed worktree. The Gateway creates the session, finishes dispatch, and only then sends the first turn. The server badge in the session sidebar shows the durable placement state. Startup recovery retains the repository URL and ref along with the destination and first message.

Choosing **Stop cloud worker…** while the new session is still provisioning pauses its initial message before requesting teardown. A late dispatch response cannot send that message. The draft stays visible for **Retry** and is not resubmitted automatically. Regular session drafts survive reconnects and page reloads; incognito drafts remain only in the current page. If the first message was already sent, uncertain delivery remains **Check delivery** rather than starting another turn.

While a placement is active, OpenClaw automatically samples available space on the remote workspace volume. Low-space warnings appear in the selected chat and on the session's cloud badge. They are advisory, clear automatically after space recovers, and do not stop or reclaim the worker.

### Cloud child sessions

When an OpenClaw worker uses `sessions_spawn`, the Gateway creates a visible child session in a separate managed worktree, provisions a worker with the parent's profile, and submits the initial task before returning acceptance. The call does not wait for the child task to finish.

While that call is waiting, the parent remains an active turn under its existing run timeout. Quiet provisioning alone does not let a queued message take over the parent or make recovery abort it early. Worker progress does not extend the timeout, and the chat **Stop** control or `/stop` can still cancel the turn. Use **Stop cloud worker…** separately to reconcile the workspace and release the machine.

### Runtime support

- **OpenClaw** uses `worker-turn` placement. The restricted `openclaw worker` process runs each turn on the leased node and proxies inference through the Gateway.
- **Codex** uses `remote-exec` placement on the same bundled Crabbox cloud profile, an eligible paired device, or a provider that advertises an SSH-backed execution carrier. The Gateway keeps the Codex app-server and authentication local; an enrolled cloud node runs only the explicitly authorized Codex exec-server and does not start an OpenClaw worker child.

The Control UI checks each cloud destination's advertised execution modes in both New Session and Move Session. One Crabbox **Cloud · profile** row is selectable for OpenClaw and Codex, while a genuinely single-mode provider stays disabled for the other runtime. An incompatible move is rejected before the active source starts draining or changes its durable placement.

Other runtimes remain unavailable unless their harness explicitly declares a cloud placement mode. Cloud targets are not offered for external CLI session catalogs. Remote-exec fails closed if the selected provider or placement sandbox is unavailable; it never falls back to running the operation on the Gateway host.

### Codex on a paired device

Paired-device Codex placement requires the `codex` plugin to be installed and
enabled in both the Gateway's configuration and the node's own local
configuration. Include `codex` in `plugins.allow` on either machine when that
machine uses a plugin allowlist. It also requires a connected session-capable
node that advertises `codex.exec-server`, and an explicit
`gateway.nodes.commands.allow` entry for `codex.exec-server.stdio.v1`. Approve
the node's updated pairing surface if needed. Before each exec-server launch,
OpenClaw also requires the normal node invocation approval; denying that
request does not start a process.

Codex launches its exec-server directly, so paired-device and cloud-node placement do not consume an OpenClaw worker slot and remain eligible when those slots are full. OpenClaw `worker-turn` placement still requires an available worker slot.

Approval permits process execution and filesystem access anywhere the node's
operating system account allows. The exact placement workspace controls the
starting directory and reconciled changes, not OS-level confinement. Trust the
paired device, and use a separate least-privilege OS account when isolation is
required.

Choose the device in the Control UI **Place** picker or dispatch a
managed-worktree session with an authorized operator connection:

```bash
openclaw gateway call sessions.dispatch \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:device-work","deviceId":"<paired-device-id>"}'
```

The Codex app-server, model connection, provider credentials, and transcript
remain on the Gateway. The paired node runs the managed Codex exec-server in
the transferred workspace and receives only sanitized process, filesystem,
capability-discovery, and HTTP operations over the existing node channel. It
does not launch an OpenClaw worker child. Credential-bearing HTTP requests are
rejected before they reach the paired device; run authenticated requests on the
Gateway or use an intentionally credential-free endpoint. Normal Codex turns
are supported, but `/btw` side questions are not yet placement-bound and fail
visibly. Completed changes return through the same placement workspace
reconciliation as worker turns. See
[Run Codex on a paired device](/plugins/codex-harness#run-codex-on-a-paired-device)
for the exact allowlist configuration and lifecycle.

### Codex or OpenClaw on a cloud profile

The same configured Crabbox profile can host either harness. Select its **Cloud · profile** row after choosing an OpenClaw or Codex model; the selected runtime determines whether provisioning prepares a worker child or the managed Codex exec-server. Codex cloud-node execution requires the same explicit Gateway command allowlist and placement-scoped approval as paired-device execution. It never falls back to Gateway-local or SSH execution if the node command is missing, denied, or disconnected.

For cloud-profile placement, the equivalent RPC flow is:

Create a repository session, dispatch it, then send its first message. Profile dispatch requires `operator.admin` and is available only while at least one worker profile is configured:

```bash
openclaw gateway call sessions.create \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:big-refactor","repository":{"url":"https://github.com/example/project.git","ref":"main"}}'

openclaw gateway call sessions.dispatch \
  --timeout 1500000 \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:big-refactor","profileId":"aws"}'
```

Omit `ref` to use the repository's remote default branch. A branch, tag, or commit must be fetchable from that repository. The first successful preparation pins the exact commit; later dispatches restore that commit and the accepted checkpoint even if the branch moves. Do not combine `repository` with `cwd`, `projectId`, `projectGitUrl`, `worktree`, or worktree naming options, and do not include an initial message in this create request. Sending before active placement is rejected with dispatch guidance.

To keep the existing Gateway-source flow, create with `{"worktree":true,"cwd":"/path/to/repo","worktreeName":"big-refactor"}` instead. `projectGitUrl` still means a Gateway-managed project clone.

Private repository fetches use the effective shared [`tools.github`](/gateway/config-tools#tools-github) identity. Access through the Control UI repository picker does not by itself authorize that worker identity, and personal publication credentials are never used for the checkout.

Repository setup uses the existing executable `.openclaw/worktree-setup.sh` contract on the node. It runs only when creation requested setup as an administrator and the current dispatch caller is also an administrator. An interrupted initial setup requires an administrator to retry dispatch; checkpoint restoration does not rerun setup. There is no local source from which to copy `.worktreeinclude` files.

### Choose a machine class per session

A worker profile's `settings.class`, when configured, remains its default. In the Control UI, selecting a **Cloud · profile** destination in the Place picker reveals a machine section listing the profile's advertised classes, with reported vCPU and RAM when available and the default marked; picking one updates the place chip (for example `hetzner · Fast`) and carries the choice into dispatch. To choose a different size for one new placement over RPC instead, pass `machineClass` with `profileId`:

```bash
openclaw gateway call sessions.dispatch \
  --timeout 1500000 \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:big-refactor","profileId":"aws","machineClass":"large"}'
```

The bundled Crabbox provider reads `classCatalog.profiles` from `crabbox providers --json` for the selected backend when `classCatalog.disposition` is `mapped`. It uses Linux/amd64 primary profiles, preserving their order and marking the configured class as the default; other targets, architectures, and fallback machines are not merged into these choices. The picker includes at most 32 options; it appends the configured class only when a usable advertised list exists. A classless profile retains all advertised choices up to that limit, with no invented default or reserved default slot. Reported vCPU and RAM appear independently. RAM follows Crabbox's summary contract: positive integer GB/GiB values are shown; other units, fractional values, and missing dimensions stay unknown. Native type names are never used to guess dimensions. Unmapped, missing, unknown, failed, empty, or unusable catalog metadata produces no machine selector, even if legacy `classes` are present. The cloud profile remains selectable, and dispatch or Move without an override preserves its configuration.

Successful catalogs, including valid empty catalogs, are cached for the Gateway lifetime. Failed probes are retried by the next discovery request; a Gateway restart is not needed to recover.

Mapped Machine0 classes appear even when Crabbox omits the legacy `classes` summary. These static mappings describe class choices, not current capacity or availability. OpenClaw does not translate provider-native size catalogs into classes. Keep native size selection in Crabbox's configuration: an explicitly configured native size still takes precedence over a class, so the picker cannot override that pin or promise a resize. Acceptance of native server types through `machineClass` is backend-specific, not a universal Crabbox contract. An admitted machine choice remains fixed for that placement and is reused by provisioning retries; catalog changes do not rewrite it. `machineClass` is valid only with `profileId`, not `deviceId`.

`sessions.dispatch` closes local turn admission, drains active work, validates the workspace source, provisions the lease for the selected execution mode, and runs setup. With project warm images enabled, it prepares the committed checkout and node runtime and captures any needed image before enrollment. It then enrolls the node, installs the required pinned Gateway bundle, applies the session workspace, and returns once the placement reaches `active` ownership. Gateway-source inventory validation happens before provider allocation. Repository-only inventory is captured on the enrolled node after fetching the pinned source; either path reports actionable size or entry limits. Budget several minutes for the first cloud dispatch, including capture when needed; later dispatches can reuse the image, project seed, and runtime installs. After that, talk to the session as usual. OpenClaw turns route to the worker process; Codex native operations run on the authorized cloud node, paired device, or supported SSH-backed provider.

For a Gateway-source worktree, synchronization is not continuous: OpenClaw sends a fresh eligible inventory at dispatch, not before every turn on an existing worker. Files created only on the Gateway after dispatch remain local and outside the accepted manifest. To send those new inputs, finish the current turn, stop the cloud worker, and dispatch again.

Remote-exec skill bundles are private, read-only turn inputs inside the execution workspace. They are ignored by ordinary Git staging and excluded from workspace synchronization and reconciliation. Normal turn cleanup removes them; cleanup failures are reported. Before preparing the next turn, OpenClaw removes leftover private skill copies from that workspace, including copies whose initialization response was lost. This also runs when the new turn selects no skills. Recovery preserves attachments and unrelated directories, and a cleanup failure stops preparation with retry guidance.

The skill catalog and explicit skill references point to the current turn's worker copy. Instructions and relative scripts use that same location; edits to the Gateway source apply to later turns.

Disconnected workers have no cleanup deadline. Nodes also reclaim copies when the authoritative retention snapshot releases their workspace generation, including after restart; SSH-backed copies follow workspace/provider teardown. Restarting a node alone does not delete a retained generation. Skill-copy paths last only for their turn, so background commands must not depend on them remaining available afterward.

Completed cloud turns preserve eligible, size-bounded workspace files before the turn claim is released. Repository-only sessions accept a cumulative immutable checkpoint in the Gateway's bare artifact repository. Gateway-source sessions apply those changes to their managed worktree. Worker-turn uses its terminal worker event to create the durable pending-result fence. Remote-exec waits for workspace quiescence and enters the same reconciliation flow after the local Codex attempt. Before applying the result, the Gateway stages complete authenticated base/current manifests plus each changed resulting blob as a Git ref under `refs/openclaw/worker-results/`; deletions are represented by the manifests and need no blob. This keeps the cloud delta recoverable even if the Gateway stops during the apply without duplicating unchanged baseline content. Workspace results use Git file semantics: regular files, executable bits, symlinks, additions, changes, and deletions are retained, while empty directories and other directory modes are not. Gateway-source changes remain in the managed worktree for normal review and commit; repository-only changes remain on the node and in the accepted checkpoint.

Replacement and Gateway Move restore files against the pinned base; they do not restore worker commit history, merge stages, or partial staging. After a recorded cloud publication, Gateway Move continues the local branch from that verified pushed commit while keeping later accepted file changes available for review. Review recovered conflict-marker files before continuing. When a publishable checkpoint is available, restoration marks its added files as intent-to-add, keeping added and edited contents unstaged for review. Accepted publication deletions are restored as staged index removals; any recovered file bytes remain available. Ignored recovery-only files and attachments are not enrolled for publication. If publication capture was unavailable, recovered ignored files need an explicit `git add -f` before publishing.

For each OpenClaw `worker-turn`, the Gateway binds its effective shared GitHub identity into the worker's `exec` launches, using the same [`tools.github`](/gateway/config-tools#tools-github) selection as ordinary Gateway-host exec. When that identity is available, `gh` is authenticated and HTTPS `git push` uses the `gh auth git-credential` helper. The worker checkout carries the session-owned branch name and, for GitHub repositories, an HTTPS `origin`. The agent commits and pushes directly from the worker. Reconciliation preserves file contents, not the worker's commit history, so work pushed from the worker lands on GitHub first. At every turn start, the worker fast-forwards its checkout to the session branch on `origin` when the local branch is behind, bringing in history pushed by an earlier worker; a diverged local branch is left untouched.

Codex `remote-exec` sessions and the Control UI **Publish PR** action use the Gateway publication broker; remote-exec agents request publication with `github_publish`. Repository-only publication uses an accepted Git-normalized checkpoint without creating a Gateway checkout. Shared or explicitly selected personal publication can use that checkpoint after Stop; personal credentials remain on the Gateway. See [Publish with your account](/concepts/user-model#publish-with-your-account).

For Gateway-source worktrees, apply uses the latest accepted manifest as the merge base, initialized at dispatch and advanced after each accepted reconciliation. Cloud-only changes are applied, local-only changes stay in place, and paths changed on both sides use a three-way keep-local policy. A conflicted turn still finishes: the transcript reports the bounded path summary and staged result ref, the placement exposes the same conflict for the Control UI, and non-conflicting cloud changes remain applied. The notice includes `git show <ref>:<path>` to inspect a present cloud file and a top-level literal-pathspec `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` command to take it from any workspace directory. Run the commands in Bash or zsh (Git Bash on Windows). If inspect says the path does not exist, the cloud result deleted it; verify and remove the retained local path manually. If checkout reports a file/directory obstruction, move or remove the blocking local path and retry. If the staged ref itself is gone, treat the notice as stale and do not change the local path. Conflicted staged refs remain available after the normal turn fence is released; a later clean result clears the notice and retires the old ref, while explicit fence removal is the final cleanup boundary.

While a fenced result is still reconciling, a new turn waits up to 15 seconds for the prior claim to release. If it is still busy, the turn fails with an actionable “previous cloud turn's workspace result is still reconciling” message and can be retried shortly. On restart, recovery discovers pending and staged results before stale-claim cleanup, completes checkpoint acceptance or local apply, and reclaims dead environments only after preserving the result. An accepted Stop result can finish cleanup after restart even when its cloud environment is already destroyed; this does not restore the old turn's live authority. For Gateway-source worktrees, the bounded SQLite rollback journal makes an interrupted filesystem apply recoverable without replaying already accepted mutations.

To continue the same session somewhere else, open the **Runs on Cloud** chip and choose **Move session…**. An operator with `operator.write` can select the Gateway or an eligible paired device; selecting a configured cloud profile requires `operator.admin`. Profiles may also offer a machine class. Moving to the current profile with a different effective class replaces its worker; it is not an in-place resize, and native size overrides may take precedence over classes. The Gateway closes new admission, interrupts any active turn, reconciles the source workspace, destroys the old environment, and then activates the destination. An interrupted turn is never replayed: partial output may disappear, and you send the next turn again after the move. The exact target, including a machine override, and bounded errors are durable, so the Control UI shows **Moving to…** or the recovery error after a reconnect. If the Gateway restarts before the destination becomes active, request-bound authority is lost: recovery finishes safe source cleanup, marks the placement failed with a retry message, and does not provision the destination. Reconnect, then choose **Move session…** again.

An active paired-device placement stays `active` when its runner disconnects.
Control UI shows **Device offline** and **Waiting for device to reconnect; retry
after it returns**. Waiting is the default and keeps the remote owner and
workspace intact. Any in-flight Codex `remote-exec` attempt fails visibly, its
node exec-server and child processes are terminated, and reconnecting the same
paired device allows a fresh attempt only; the disconnected stdio session is
never resumed. **Continue on Gateway…** is explicitly destructive: after a
data-loss confirmation, it abandons the exact offline device owner and resumes
from the last Gateway-synced workspace without replay. Unsynced device files
and in-flight work may be lost. This explicit abandonment also fences an active
local Codex turn claim without waiting for an acknowledgment from the offline
node. The Gateway revokes the abandoned worker's credentials, tools, and result
authority before returning the session to local ownership. It retains the exact
old device cleanup scope until reconnection confirms physical worker shutdown;
this cleanup cannot stop or revoke a later session owner, including after a
Gateway restart. Continue on Gateway does not claim that the offline process has
already stopped. If the device is already available, use the
ordinary reconcile-first move instead.

To stop a running turn in the Control UI, use chat **Stop** or `/stop` first. Once no turn is running, choose **Stop cloud worker…** from the placement chip. The Gateway performs one final workspace reconciliation before it destroys the environment. A placement already in `draining` or `reconciling` is finishing teardown; wait for its badge to become `reclaimed` before resetting or deleting the session. An environment in `draining` or `destroying` has not yet confirmed release: teardown errors remain visible, and Stop can be retried. Starting another turn after reclaim provisions a replacement worker only while its original cloud profile remains configured for the same provider; deleting that profile prevents new cloud allocation.

Archiving or deleting a non-main cloud-worker session with an active placement first interrupts and drains its current work, then safely reclaims the worker. The Gateway records the archive or deletion only after final reconciliation and safe teardown succeed. If reclaim is unavailable, fails, or the placement is transitioning or failed without proof that its environment is gone, the operation reports an error and retains the session and recovery state; it never force-discards unsynced work. Restoring an archived session retains reclaimed placement metadata so the next turn can dispatch a fresh worker with the same workspace profile.

For a broken or runaway cloud environment, an administrator can call the admin-only `environments.destroy` method with `{ "force": true }` as a last resort. Forced teardown durably marks the placement failed and abandons any unreconciled remote result before destroying the environment. For an unreachable paired device, forced destroy succeeds without waiting for reconnection and discards unsynced device changes.

The equivalent write-scoped session RPC is:

```bash
openclaw gateway call sessions.reclaim \
  --timeout 600000 \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:big-refactor"}'
```

Calling `sessions.reclaim` while a turn is active cancels running and pending work and records the active turn’s stopped outcome before workspace reconciliation and teardown. Inputs already waiting, or submitted while reclaim is in progress, do not restart the worker when reclaim completes. Send a new message after reclaim finishes to start new work.

`sessions.reclaim` also cancels a dispatch that is still preparing or provisioning, including project snapshot and transfer work before enrollment. The UI exposes **Stop cloud worker…** once a requested or provisioning placement appears. Crabbox stops the active acquisition/setup command, readiness wait, or enrollment wait, then the Gateway completes authoritative lease cleanup before reporting success. The initial prompt remains **Not sent**; only an explicit retry sends it later. A provider that cannot interrupt an operation still retains its cleanup ownership until that operation settles. Cancellation never reports a caller timeout as proof of release.

Cancellation does not wait for unrelated provider inspections. Final reconciliation and machine release still wait for earlier placement operations to finish. A later dispatch or move of the same session waits for reclaim, so it cannot replace the worker before Stop finishes.

The result placement is `reclaimed` after an active worker is safely stopped. Reclaim also waits for an in-flight dispatch and retries pending teardown for a failed placement before returning `local`. No other placement states are successful reclaim results.

Crabbox lease teardown reserves time for the CLI's full bounded release attempts, retries, cleanup observation, and process settlement. Inspection keeps its shorter timeout. Failed node enrollment also reserves time for diagnostics before teardown; optional image capture has its own additional budget.

If provider teardown fails or times out during stop or move, the request reports the bounded, redacted provider cause even if recovery subsequently finishes cleanup. Retrying Stop on a failed placement reports that cleanup attempt's cause, which can differ from the original session failure. Follow the reported recovery guidance and check the current placement before retrying. A dedicated cloud worker can remain recorded as attached while destruction is uncertain, but its closed authority cannot resume remote workspace processes.

An ended or unusable provider lease is not proof that its machine was deleted. OpenClaw fences that worker, stops renewing the lease, and requests explicit provider teardown. Failed teardown stays retryable; a missing local claim or an earlier “not found” warning does not turn a failed stop into success.

For automation, read the active placement's `generation`, `environmentId`, and `activeOwnerEpoch` from `sessions.describe`, then supply those exact source facts to `sessions.move`:

```bash
openclaw gateway call sessions.move \
  --timeout 1500000 \
  --params '{"key":"agent:main:big-refactor","expected":{"generation":5,"environmentId":"worker:source","ownerEpoch":2},"target":{"kind":"gateway"}}'
```

Worker targets use `{"kind":"profile","profileId":"aws","machineClass":"fast"}` or `{"kind":"device","deviceId":"paired-device-id"}`. Omit `machineClass` to use the profile default. Moving to the same profile with a different class is the resize workflow. A stale source is rejected rather than moving a newer placement. Successful results end in `local` for the Gateway target or `active` for a worker target.

An explicit move of a repository-only session to the Gateway fetches its pinned source into a managed project, creates a managed worktree, and restores its accepted checkpoint before enabling local turns. Ordinary creation, Stop, restart, and publication do not materialize this checkout. Moving requires upstream access to the pinned commit, any recorded publication commit, and enough Gateway disk space for the normal managed-worktree flow. The move requires in-flight publication to settle and rejects a remote branch that differs from the recorded push; it never adopts an unrelated remote tip. Fetching uses the shared repository identity, so a prior personal publication does not require reconnecting that personal account to move.

Automation may explicitly abandon an offline paired-device source by adding
`"abandonSource":true` to the exact-source Gateway request above. The field is
rejected for profile or device targets and when the source runner is available
or cannot be proven to be the exact device binding. This path has the same
unsynced-file and in-flight-work loss boundary as the Control UI confirmation.

Placement moves through a durable state machine (`local → requested → provisioning → syncing → starting → active`), so a Gateway restart mid-dispatch reconciles instead of leaking machines; interrupted pending provisioning retains its fixed provider operation for startup replay. A failed model turn keeps the active placement available for a retry. In Gateway-source worktrees, workspace path conflicts keep the local version, apply the rest of the cloud result, and preserve the staged cloud ref for inspection; other reconciliation or lifecycle failures retain their durable recovery fence and diagnostic tail until recovery can safely retry or reclaim the environment.

Recovery requested for one worker inspects that environment and resumes only its associated workspace results and moves. Regular background sweeps still reconcile all environments. Recovery continues to wait for earlier placement operations to finish.

If a turn reports `Cloud worker finished, but its workspace result could not be reconciled`, inspect the cause after the colon. A failed node manifest capture includes its bounded, redacted stderr, or its termination status when stderr is empty. Node cleanup preserves manifests needed between upload and verification, including when other workers finish simultaneously; increasing transfer timeouts does not repair a missing manifest.

## What survives a dead machine

The Gateway owns the canonical session transcript in both modes. Worker-turn commits each complete user, assistant, and tool-result message before the worker's session write settles; remote-exec uses the normal local harness transcript path because the Codex app-server stays on the Gateway. If the machine disappears mid-message, durable history ends at the last committed message. Partial text or tool progress already shown by the live stream may disappear; the failed turn remains visible, and the failed placement records a bounded terminal reason above the composer.

Worker-turn live previews are snapshots of the current assistant message. Corrections, shorter previews, and empty replacements update that message without replaying or erasing earlier messages in the turn. Explicit commentary is kept out of answer text, including when its phase arrives at message completion. Live previews are bounded and can be dropped after stream degradation; the committed transcript remains authoritative.

Workspace state has a wider loss window. A completed turn reconciles cloud files before releasing its claim, and **Stop cloud worker…**, archiving, or deleting a session performs final reconciliation before destroying an active worker. Changes made between reconciliations exist only on the box and can be lost if that box disappears. Deletion proceeds only after safe reclaim succeeds. For a Gateway-source session it snapshots the managed worktree under `refs/openclaw/snapshots/` before removing it; for a repository-only session it deletes the source owner and retained checkpoint artifacts. A failed safe reclaim retains the session and unsynced recovery state and reports an error.

For repository-only sessions, the Gateway retains complete base/current file manifests and changed file contents in immutable checkpoints. It does not keep a full copy of upstream Git history or unchanged base files. Replacement workers therefore need the pinned upstream commit to be fetchable or already present in the node's verified seed cache. An explicit Gateway move needs that commit available to its project clone. A moved or deleted remote branch does not change the pinned commit, but losing access to that commit can prevent restoration.

Checkpoint history stays until session deletion; the managed-worktree seven-day idle cleanup and thirty-day snapshot expiry do not apply. Back up the [state database and repository artifacts](/reference/database-schemas#cloud-repository-workspaces) together. This saves Gateway checkout space, not all storage used by a session's accepted changes.

While the worker is active, **Files**, file editing, and diffs inspect its actual checkout through the authenticated node connection. After Stop, retained changed-file previews and change paths remain available, but unchanged upstream files, editing, and full diffs require a running worker. The diff panel explains that the workspace is stopped. Opening these views never substitutes the agent's Gateway workspace.

After a failed placement, redispatch the session and retry the turn. A reclaimed placement redispatches automatically on the next turn. The next turn rebuilds model context from the Gateway transcript, so it continues from the messages that crossed the durability boundary.

## Desktop (interactive)

Cloud Worker Desktop lets an administrator watch or control a capable worker from the Control UI without exposing its cloud node as an ordinary paired node. Enable the **Cloud Worker Desktop** lab, then set `settings.desktop: true` on a Crabbox profile. Desktop capability is fixed at warm time: changing the setting affects newly provisioned workers, while an existing non-desktop lease must be stopped and reprovisioned.

The bundled Crabbox plugin supports direct AWS profiles. Coordinator-backed AWS and Hetzner profiles are supported when the selected coordinator advertises Desktop and Browser capability. OpenClaw keeps worker execution node-only: `openclaw worker`, workspace transfer, desktop observation, and app launch all use the authenticated outbound node connection. It does not restore SSH execution, a reverse tunnel, or rsync. Direct Hetzner rejects OpenClaw's fixed lease ID, so desktop profiles fail before allocation unless Hetzner uses a capable managed coordinator.

Crabbox provisions XFCE on display `:99`, an authenticated RFB server on `127.0.0.1:5900`, a fresh lease-scoped browser profile with CDP on `127.0.0.1:9222`, and fixed zero-argument Browser and Terminal launchers. The provider also installs an OpenClaw worker wallpaper so the disposable desktop is easy to identify. Setup is idempotent and runs before node enrollment on every provisioning replay.

The enrolled node starts CUA inside that same XFCE session. A vision-capable agent whose tool policy permits `computer` controls this desktop through the session's exact placement; it cannot select another node. This works for both OpenClaw workers and Codex remote execution. See [Desktop and computer control](/gateway/cloud-sessions#desktop-and-computer-control) for tool enablement and manual-control guidance.

The desktop never gains public ingress. The node reads `/var/lib/crabbox/vnc.password` locally, inspects the loopback RFB security offer, and keeps that same connection for the viewer. It redeems a single-use Gateway broker ticket over the node's already-connected origin. Opening viewers therefore creates no extra unauthenticated probe connections. TLS deployments pin the same Gateway certificate used by the node connection. The Gateway revalidates the durable environment, lease, node, owner epoch, desktop descriptor, connection, and pairing both before dispatch and after attach; drain, replacement, or teardown aborts the stream and any pending app launch. The shared desktop session owner performs RFB preauthentication, view-only input filtering, and single-controller arbitration.

The Gateway sends WebSocket keepalives on desktop observer and node desktop or portal streams while idle, so an unchanged screen or quiet preview does not go silent behind a proxy. Backpressure may delay pong replies without revoking the stream; the owning session and control connection still govern teardown.

## Security model

- **Closed worker ingress.** In worker-turn mode, the enrolled node launches the worker child, which dials the Gateway's authenticated public worker route and speaks a dedicated protocol with a closed method allowlist — a worker cannot call operator RPCs.
- **Gateway-owned tool authority.** In worker-turn mode, the Gateway projects current profile, provider, agent, group, sender, sandbox, delegation, inherited, and runtime-cap policy over the worker's fixed coding-tool catalog before every turn. The launch envelope carries only that final closed-vocabulary subset. Explicitly capped scheduled turns reuse their trusted owner-group context without sending that identity to the box or reapplying a fresh sender overlay. Tools outside the worker catalog remain unavailable; an empty result runs with no tools.
- **Minted credentials, hashed at rest.** Each dispatch mints a worker credential; the Gateway stores only its hash. Credential rotation and owner-epoch fencing guarantee at most one live owner per session — a stale worker that reconnects is fenced, never merged.
- **Environment-bound enrollment.** One short-lived node-only setup credential is bound to the durable environment before allocation. Its first authenticated Ed25519 device identity is recorded atomically with setup completion; replay cannot substitute an unrelated node.
- **Explicit Codex node authorization.** Cloud-node and paired-device remote execution require an explicitly allowed `codex.exec-server.stdio.v1` command, an approved pairing surface, and critical node invocation approval. Allow once never grants a later launch. Allow always creates an in-memory standing grant owned by the current Gateway process, with a 30-day maximum lifetime. Gateway restart clears it, and every launch revalidates the exact active placement, node pairing, environment owner, command approval scope, and workspace immediately before dispatch. The managed exec-server starts with a fresh private home and sanitized environment. Its managed workspace is not an OS sandbox: approved execution can access processes and files allowed to the node account, so use a separate least-privilege account when isolation is required.
- **Model and cloud credentials stay off the box.** OpenClaw worker turns proxy inference by `{provider, model}` reference. Codex remote-exec keeps the app-server plus ChatGPT subscription or API-key auth on the Gateway and sends only sandbox operations to the box. Remote-exec requires prepared auth and rejects ambient auth fallback. Crabbox AWS lease metadata is checked authoritatively for an instance role before setup. Keep setup commands credential-free too.
- **Turn-bound GitHub identity.** OpenClaw worker turns receive the Gateway's effective shared GitHub access token through the private launch envelope, refreshed for each turn. The worker materializes it in a private profile inside its throwaway state directory. Each turn gets its own profile directory, and earlier turns' profiles are removed before the next binding, so a process retained from an earlier turn keeps only the token it was launched with. That rotation limits inherited paths, not same-user access: processes running as the worker's operating-system user, including the agent's own background commands from earlier turns, can read worker state, exactly as on the Gateway host. Cloud workers are single-session throwaway machines; run a paired session host under a dedicated least-privilege account when isolation from the agent's earlier commands is required. The sealed worker launcher reads that profile for each `exec` launch and exposes the token only to the child process; it is never logged or journaled. Paired devices' own `gh` logins are not used.
- **Gateway-owned GitHub publication.** Control UI and Codex remote-exec publication use the Gateway broker, with credentials from the selected GitHub profile on the Gateway. Repository sessions publish an accepted Git-normalized checkpoint through GitHub's tree, commit, and compare-and-swap ref APIs. Gateway-worktree sessions use a temporary index, `git commit-tree`, and a command-local credential helper. Both paths disable repository hooks and reject unsafe Git configuration. Neither writes a bearer token to argv, a remote URL, `.git/config`, a publication request, or a transcript.
- **Provider-owned egress.** Gateway-proxied inference removes any OpenClaw need for direct model access, but OpenClaw does not rewrite provider firewalls. Restrict outbound traffic in the worker provider when the task requires it.
- **Durable, exactly-once worker transcripts.** In worker-turn mode, the worker commits transcript batches through a compare-and-swap protocol against the session's leaf; a stale base fail-stops the run instead of duplicating or rebasing paid output. Remote-exec writes through the Gateway's normal local harness path.

## Troubleshooting

- **No cloud profile is advertised** — run the `operator.read`-scoped `openclaw gateway call environments.list --params '{}'`. If the response has no `profiles`, ask an administrator to validate `cloudWorkers.profiles`, inspect the provider plugin, and restart the Gateway. This is a configuration or provider-activation problem, not an authorization result.
- **Cloud destinations are hidden or an RPC is denied** — cloud profile dispatch and profile-target moves require `operator.admin`. `operator.write` can dispatch or move to an eligible paired device, move to the Gateway, and reclaim a placement; `operator.read` alone can discover profiles but cannot start, stop, or move a session. Profile configuration, infrastructure pairing, Connect machine, raw environment lifecycle, direct `execNode` execution, incognito sessions, and arbitrary host or node paths remain `operator.admin`.
- **The selected runtime lacks cloud placement support** — choose a model whose advertised runtime supports cloud placement. The bundled OpenClaw and Codex runtimes are supported; undeclared runtimes remain local-only.
- **Codex cannot use a cloud profile** — verify that the profile advertises `remote-exec`, the Gateway enables a trusted Codex plugin installation, and `gateway.nodes.commands.allow` includes `codex.exec-server.stdio.v1` without a matching deny rule. Bootstrap supplies the cloud-node plugin automatically. Approve the exact node invocation when prompted. Codex does not require an available OpenClaw worker slot; a missing plugin or denied command must be corrected rather than bypassed with Gateway or SSH execution.
- **The portal tool is unavailable on a worker** — confirm the session uses OpenClaw `worker-turn` on an enrolled node that advertises portal-stream support. Update older node bundles when necessary. SSH-backed `remote-exec` placements, including Codex sessions, do not run the OpenClaw worker tool loop; move the session back to the Gateway with `sessions.move` when a Gateway-hosted portal is needed.
- **"Worker bootstrap requires Node.js on the leased host"** — add a Node install to `settings.setup` (see above).
- **`gh: command not found` on a cloud worker** — install GitHub CLI in `settings.setup` (see the Debian/Ubuntu example above), or install it on the paired worker host. Crabbox developer images include it; the sealed worker bundle does not.
- **AWS instance-role attestation fails** — clear `aws.instanceProfile` (and `CRABBOX_AWS_INSTANCE_PROFILE`, if set). Install Crabbox 0.41.1 or newer; older binaries do not satisfy the fixed-ID and authoritative `providerMetadata.instanceProfileAttached` contracts required for AWS admission.
- **Dispatch or workspace recovery fails** — inspect `environments.list` and `sessions.describe`. A failed environment exposes its bounded environment error. A failed placement exposes `recoveryError` plus its durable per-session `terminalReason`; the selected Control UI chat shows that terminal reason above the composer. When deeper diagnosis is necessary, an operator on the Gateway host can inspect the durable worker state read-only. Do not edit the state database to bypass lifecycle fencing.
- **Crabbox setup cannot reach the lease** — check the selected backend's networking and setup-transport requirements in the [Crabbox provider reference](https://crabbox.sh/providers/index.html). Correct Crabbox's configuration and rerun `crabbox doctor --provider <backend> --json` before retrying.
- **Session shows a reclaimed or suspended badge after being idle** — this is expected when its profile sets `suspendAfter`. The next message provisions a replacement worker, warm when an image exists.
- **A warm image is unavailable** — a new allocation can select cold provisioning before its choice is recorded. An already admitted allocation keeps its original cold/checkpoint choice through retries. If its checkpoint cannot be forked, resolve the provider error or stop that allocation before starting a replacement; retry does not switch images silently.
- **Warm-image migration or capacity blocks dispatch** — run `openclaw doctor --fix` for legacy state and follow its exact cleanup guidance. For capacity, stop outstanding workers or resolve pending image cleanup with `openclaw crabbox warm-images`; allocation choices and cleanup obligations are never evicted to make room.
- **Cloud bootstrap requests a rebuild** — run `pnpm build` in the Gateway source checkout, then restart the Gateway and retry. The running build, its package metadata, and the built plugin outputs must agree; editing source or matching the displayed version alone is insufficient.
- **Cloud bootstrap download fails** — the error identifies the connection, TLS, HTTP-response, or body-transfer phase. A `download TLS` reset happened before an HTTP response; check the worker provider's outbound policy and the Gateway's TLS endpoint from the worker, not only from the Gateway host. For an HTTP status, check proxy routing and download authorization. A `download body` error means response headers arrived; inspect the interrupted transfer, local disk, or archive-integrity error. Use a Gateway origin permitted by the provider's policy; do not disable certificate validation or bypass that policy.
- **Node enrollment times out** — inspect the bootstrap download or install error, node process state, and bounded node-log tail included in the enrollment error. Verify that profile setup installed a supported Node.js release and npm, that npm can reach the dependency registry, and that the box can reach the Gateway's advertised TLS URL. Forward `/__openclaw__/worker-bootstrap/artifacts/<sha256>` as well as the public worker/node WebSocket routes through your proxy. If the error contains `proxy_attribution_required`, add the reverse proxy's source address to `gateway.trustedProxies`.
- **Client timeout while dispatching** — `openclaw gateway call` defaults to a 10s timeout; pass `--timeout` generously. Dispatch keeps running server-side either way, and an identical retry on the same Gateway joins that in-flight operation instead of provisioning another worker. A retry with a different profile or session identity is rejected.
- **Provider authorization fails after `doctor` passes** — read-only readiness does not prove permission to allocate or tear down a lease. Inspect the denied action and follow the selected provider's provisioning and cleanup requirements in the [Crabbox provider reference](https://crabbox.sh/providers/index.html).
- **Worker reclaimed after a Gateway update** — OpenClaw releases idle cloud workers built for the previous build, keeps the session and workspace, and provisions a replacement on the next message. Workers interrupted mid-turn or while starting, or holding unaccepted results, still fail and need explicit redispatch.
- **Cloud workspace conflict notice** — the turn completed and kept the local version of each listed path. Use the staged-ref commands in the notice to inspect or take the cloud version; no retry is required for the non-conflicting changes, which are already applied.
- **Cloud session disk-space warning** — delete unneeded files from the remote workspace or stop the cloud worker before large writes. The warning clears automatically after the next successful sample shows enough free space; a failed sample leaves the last successful warning visible and does not affect the session lifecycle.
- **“The previous cloud turn's workspace result is still reconciling”** — the Gateway waited briefly for the prior result's durable fence and could not acquire the session claim. Wait for reconciliation to finish, then retry the turn; restarting the Gateway is safe because recovery preserves staged results before reclaiming a dead worker.
- **GitHub publication failed** — for Gateway-brokered publication through **Publish PR** or remote-exec `github_publish`, open **Agents → Tools → GitHub Identity** and confirm the effective `@login`, selected scope, access expiry, and refresh state. Reconnect GitHub when refresh is expired or unavailable; use a managed PAT only as the explicit fallback. For push rejection, inspect repository write access and branch drift; `/user` verification does not prove repository write access and the broker never force-pushes. For pull request rejection, grant pull-request write access and retry **Publish PR** or call `github_publish` again with a new tool call.
- **Repository publication is unavailable** — Git clean filters, unsafe Git configuration, or failed publication-snapshot validation can prevent preparing a publishable checkpoint. Raw recovery checkpoints and normal Stop still preserve accepted changes. Correct the repository configuration, then run another turn or save an edit to prepare a new checkpoint before requesting publication again.
- **Lease housekeeping** — `crabbox list --provider <backend> --json` is a read-only inventory. `crabbox stop --provider <backend> --id <lease>` and `crabbox release --provider <backend> --id <lease>` are destructive and release a lease manually. OpenClaw keeps the lease alive while its session is placed, then stops heartbeating during teardown so genuinely idle leases expire on the profile's `idleTimeout`. Crabbox 0.43.0 and older do not expose the heartbeat command; OpenClaw warns once per environment and cannot prevent coordinator-idle reaping on those binaries.

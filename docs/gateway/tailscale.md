OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale **Serve** (tailnet) or **Funnel** (public) for the Gateway dashboard and WebSocket port. This keeps the gateway bound to loopback while Tailscale provides HTTPS, routing, and (for Serve) identity headers.

## Modes

`gateway.tailscale.mode`:

| Mode            | Behavior                                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serve`         | Tailnet-only Serve via `tailscale serve`. The gateway stays on `127.0.0.1`. |
| `funnel`        | Public HTTPS via `tailscale funnel`. Requires a shared password.            |
| `off` (default) | No Tailscale automation.                                                    |

Status and audit output use **Tailscale exposure** for this OpenClaw Serve/Funnel mode. `off` means OpenClaw is not managing Serve or Funnel; it does not mean the local Tailscale daemon is stopped or logged out.

## Config examples

### Tailnet-only (Serve)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "serve" },
  },
}
```

Open: `https://<magicdns>/` (or your configured `gateway.controlUi.basePath`)

### Tailnet-only (bind to Tailnet IP)

Use this to have the gateway listen directly on the Tailnet IP, with no Serve/Funnel:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "tailnet",
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-token" },
  },
}
```

Connect a native or CLI client from another Tailnet device:

- WebSocket: `ws://<tailscale-ip>:18789`

Do not use the direct plain-HTTP address for the browser Control UI. Remote plain HTTP cannot create browser device identity, and token/password auth does not replace it. Use Tailscale Serve for the Control UI.

<Note>
When a bindable Tailnet IPv4 is present, the Gateway also requires `http://127.0.0.1:18789` for authenticated same-host clients. If no Tailnet address is available at startup, it falls back to loopback only; restart after Tailscale becomes available to add direct Tailnet access. Neither path adds LAN or public exposure.
</Note>

### Public internet (Funnel + shared password)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "funnel" },
    auth: { mode: "password", password: "replace-me" },
  },
}
```

Prefer `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` over committing a password to disk.

The Funnel URL also remains usable from devices inside the tailnet. Tailscale marks public
requests as Funnel traffic but sends tailnet peers through its Serve identity path instead;
OpenClaw recognizes both paths on its dedicated listener and still requires the configured
Funnel password.

## CLI examples

```bash
openclaw gateway --tailscale serve
openclaw gateway --tailscale funnel --auth password
```

## Auth

`gateway.auth.mode` controls the handshake:

| Mode                                                   | Use case                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`                                                 | Private ingress only                                                                |
| `token` (default when `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set) | Shared token                                                                        |
| `password`                                             | Shared secret via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` or config                             |
| `trusted-proxy`                                        | Identity-aware reverse proxy; see [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth) |

### Tailscale identity headers (Serve only)

When `tailscale.mode: "serve"` and `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`, Control UI/WebSocket auth can use Tailscale identity headers (`tailscale-user-login`) instead of a token/password. OpenClaw verifies the header by resolving the request's `x-forwarded-for` address via the local Tailscale daemon (`tailscale whois`) and matching it to the header login before accepting it. A request only qualifies when it reaches OpenClaw's dedicated managed-Tailscale listener with Tailscale's `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, and `x-forwarded-host` headers. Those headers never establish managed Serve provenance or tokenless auth on the ordinary Gateway listener.

This tokenless flow assumes the gateway host is trusted. If untrusted local code may run on the same host, set `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false` and require token/password auth instead.

Scope of the bypass:

- Applies to the Control UI WebSocket auth surface and read-only `GET`/`HEAD` requests for Control UI profile avatars. Other HTTP API endpoints (`/v1/*`, `/tools/invoke`, `/api/channels/*`, etc.) never use Tailscale identity-header auth; they always follow the gateway's normal HTTP auth mode.
- For Control UI operator sessions that already carry browser device identity, a verified Tailscale identity skips the bootstrap-token/QR pairing round trip.
- It does not bypass device identity itself: device-less clients are still rejected, and node-role connections still go through normal pairing and auth checks.

### Externally managed Serve and Funnel

You can point a native Tailscale Serve or Funnel route at the ordinary Gateway listener when another service owns the route. Configure the route's immediate source narrowly in `gateway.trustedProxies`, and ensure it overwrites or safely rebuilds `X-Forwarded-For`. OpenClaw then treats the request as generic `trusted-proxy` ingress, uses the forwarded client address for rate limits, and applies the configured gateway auth mode normally. Because Funnel is public, Gateway-protected routes reject externally managed Funnel ingress when `gateway.auth.mode` is `none`; configure token, password, or trusted-proxy authentication. The aggregate health, readiness, and startup probes retain their existing unauthenticated responses, without exposing detailed readiness or startup data. See [Health and readiness](/gateway/health).

This compatibility path does not grant managed Tailscale semantics: `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` cannot provide tokenless auth, OpenClaw does not call `tailscale whois`, and it does not own or clean up the external route. Without an explicitly trusted source and a valid non-loopback forwarded client address, Gateway-authenticated routes fail with `proxy_attribution_required`. If the proxy connects over loopback, adding `127.0.0.1` to `trustedProxies` explicitly trusts same-host processes to supply proxy attribution; keep token or password auth enabled unless every process on the host belongs to the same trust boundary.

## Notes

- Tailscale Serve/Funnel requires the `tailscale` CLI installed and logged in.
- `tailscale.mode: "funnel"` refuses to start unless auth mode is `password`, to avoid public exposure.
- OpenClaw holds Serve/Funnel as a foreground Tailscale claim. Gateway startup succeeds only after the claim is active, and stopping or losing the Gateway releases it automatically.
- With managed ingress enabled, startup adopts a predecessor background HTTPS root route on its managed port when the target is exactly `http://127.0.0.1:<configured-gateway-port>` or the equivalent `localhost` URL (with an optional trailing slash), replaces it with the dedicated managed listener, and logs the adoption. Routes to other targets, or roots sharing their port with other handlers or hostnames, remain untouched; startup reports the conflicting HTTPS port and recovery guidance, while Doctor leaves externally managed configuration unchanged.
- Named Tailscale Services are not supported by managed ingress because Tailscale requires them to run as persistent background routes. Existing `gateway.tailscale.serviceName` installs must run `openclaw doctor --fix`; Doctor disables managed ingress and removes the key. Inspect the retained Service route, clear it with `tailscale serve clear <service-name>`, then enable device Serve with `gateway.tailscale.mode: "serve"` if desired.
- Older releases could advertise an externally configured default HTTPS Serve route that targeted a `gateway.bind: "lan"` listener. That route does not automatically gain trusted ingress provenance. Run `openclaw doctor` to inspect it; Doctor leaves the configuration unchanged because it cannot prove who owns the route. If you confirm the route belongs to the current Tailscale hostname and is stale from an older OpenClaw release, remove only its root handler with `tailscale serve --yes --https=443 --set-path=/ off` or `tailscale funnel --yes --https=443 --set-path=/ off`, then configure `gateway.bind: "loopback"` plus `gateway.tailscale.mode: "serve"` manually and restart the Gateway. If another service must retain ownership, leave managed Tailscale ingress off and use the explicit `trustedProxies` compatibility path above.
- `gateway.tailscale.preserveFunnel: true` is a deprecated migration guard. It detects an externally configured `tailscale funnel` route before reapplying Serve. If that route still targets the ordinary Gateway listener, OpenClaw leaves it unchanged and warns because the route is not managed ingress. Gateway-authenticated routes work only through the explicit `trustedProxies` compatibility path above and continue to require the configured auth; plugin-authenticated webhook routes such as Google Chat and SMS keep using their own signature/auth checks. To migrate, first configure a durable `gateway.auth.password` (prefer a SecretRef) or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`, set `gateway.auth.mode` to `password`, run `openclaw config set gateway.tailscale.mode funnel`, then `openclaw config unset gateway.tailscale.preserveFunnel`.
- `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` uses a direct Tailnet bind (no HTTPS, no Serve/Funnel) plus required local `127.0.0.1` when a Tailnet IPv4 is available; otherwise it falls back to loopback only.
- `gateway.bind: "auto"` prefers loopback; use `tailnet` to limit network exposure to the Tailnet while retaining same-host loopback access.
- Serve/Funnel only expose the **Gateway control UI + WS**. Nodes connect over the same Gateway WS endpoint, so Serve works for node access too.

### Tailscale prerequisites and limits

- Serve requires HTTPS enabled for your tailnet; the CLI prompts if it is missing.
- Tailnet Serve traffic injects Tailscale identity headers. Public Funnel traffic uses a Funnel
  marker instead, while tailnet access to the same Funnel URL follows the Serve identity path.
- OpenClaw-managed Serve/Funnel proxy to a dedicated `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>` listener while ordinary local clients keep the configured Gateway port. Startup fails closed rather than sharing listener provenance, and the foreground claim releases the route when its Gateway owner disappears.
- Funnel requires Tailscale v1.38.3+, MagicDNS, HTTPS enabled, and a funnel node attribute.
- Funnel only supports ports `443`, `8443`, and `10000` over TLS.
- Funnel on macOS requires the open-source Tailscale app variant.

## Recover an orphaned foreground claim

Older Gateways could leave a foreground Tailscale claim running after a forced
shutdown. Updating prevents new orphans but does not remove existing claims.

If startup reports an occupied HTTPS port, run `tailscale serve status --json`.
Check `Foreground` for the reported session, hostname, path, and proxy target.
On macOS or Linux, inspect candidate CLI processes with
`ps -axo pid,ppid,args | grep '[t]ailscale'`. Confirm which process created that
route before stopping it with `kill -TERM <confirmed-pid>`. Tailscale status does
not report the claimant PID; a backend listener PID or an orphaned parent alone
does not prove ownership. If another application owns the claim, leave it alone
and keep OpenClaw managed ingress off until you resolve the conflict.

Verify that the foreground session disappears from `tailscale serve status
--json`, then restart the Gateway. `tailscale serve --https=443 --set-path=/ off`
removes a background Web handler; it does not release a foreground claim.

## Browser control (remote Gateway + local browser)

To run the Gateway on one machine but drive a browser on another, run a **node host** on the browser machine and keep both on the same tailnet. The Gateway proxies browser actions to the node; no separate control server or Serve URL is needed.

Avoid Funnel for browser control; treat node pairing like operator access.

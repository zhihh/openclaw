summary: "CLI backends: local AI CLI fallback with optional MCP tool bridge"
read_when:
  - You want a reliable fallback when API providers fail
  - You are running local AI CLIs and want to reuse them
  - You want to understand the MCP loopback bridge for CLI backend tool access
title: "CLI backends"
---

OpenClaw can run a local AI CLI as a text-only fallback when API providers are down, rate-limited, or misbehaving. It is intentionally conservative:

- OpenClaw tools are not injected directly, but a backend with `bundleMcp: true` can receive gateway tools through a loopback MCP bridge.
- JSONL streaming for CLIs that support it.
- Sessions are supported, so follow-up turns stay coherent.
- Images pass through if the CLI accepts image paths.

Use it as a safety net for "always works" text responses, not a primary path. For a full harness runtime with ACP session controls, background tasks, thread/conversation binding, and persistent external coding sessions, use [ACP Agents](/tools/acp-agents) instead; CLI backends are not ACP.

</Tip>

## Quick start

The bundled Anthropic plugin registers a default `claude-cli` backend, so it works with no config beyond having Claude Code installed and logged in:

```bash
openclaw agent --agent main --message "hi" --model claude-cli/claude-sonnet-5
```

`main` is the default agent id when no explicit agent list is configured; swap in your own agent id otherwise.

The gateway service must have the CLI on its `PATH`. If a deployment needs a
nonstandard executable path or arguments, register that adapter in a
[CLI backend plugin](/plugins/cli-backend-plugins) instead of putting launch
mechanics in `openclaw.json`.

OpenClaw auto-loads an owning bundled plugin when model selection or a
model-scoped `agentRuntime.id` references its backend.

Utility completions for session digests, progress narration, and tool-call titles use the selected model's runtime too: Claude CLI runs a fresh, tool-free completion with its own authentication, including canonical `anthropic/*` refs configured with `agentRuntime.id: "claude-cli"`.

## Using it as a fallback

Add the CLI backend to your fallback list so it only runs when primary models fail:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6",
        fallbacks: ["claude-cli/claude-sonnet-5"],
      },
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": { alias: "Opus" },
        "claude-cli/claude-sonnet-5": {},
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Configured fallbacks remain eligible when the primary provider fails (auth, rate limits, timeouts), even when they are not in `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow`. Add a CLI backend model to that policy only when users should also be able to select it directly through `/model`, a session override, or `--model`. `agents.defaults.models` only owns per-model aliases, parameters, and metadata.

## Configuration

Users choose a registered backend through the model and runtime policy. Keep
the model ref canonical and select the CLI runtime per model:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: "anthropic/claude-opus-5",
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-5": {
          agentRuntime: { id: "claude-cli" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Credentials remain in OpenClaw auth profiles or the owning plugin's config.
Command, argv, environment, parsing, session, image, and watchdog mechanics are
plugin code registered with `api.registerCliBackend(...)`.

## How it works

1. Selects a backend by provider prefix (`claude-cli/...`).
2. Builds a system prompt using the same OpenClaw prompt and workspace context.
3. Executes the CLI with a session id (if supported) so history stays consistent. The bundled `claude-cli` backend communicates directly with the installed Claude Code executable and keeps its authenticated subprocess warm across compatible agent turns.
4. Parses output (JSON or plain text) and returns the final text.
5. Persists session ids per backend so follow-ups reuse the same CLI session.

## Timeouts and long-running work

CLI backends have two independent limits:

- `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` limits the whole agent turn. Normal Gateway turns inherit the 48-hour default; `0` makes the turn budget unlimited. A stored override such as `600` replaces that default.
- The CLI no-output watchdog stops a subprocess that remains silent. Each backend plugin owns separate fresh/resume profiles, and the watchdog remains active even when the overall turn budget is unlimited.

Remove a short overall-timeout override to return to the 48-hour default, or set an explicit budget such as 12 hours:

```bash
# Return to the 48-hour default:
openclaw config unset agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds

# Or choose an explicit 12-hour limit:
openclaw config set agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds 43200
```

Background work started inside a CLI is still part of that CLI subprocess. If the parent turn reaches its overall limit, OpenClaw stops the subprocess and its CLI-internal background tasks together. For durable long work, use a detached OpenClaw [sub-agent](/tools/subagents) or [ACP agent](/tools/acp-agents); detached sub-agents have no run timeout by default.

The `openclaw agent` command also has its own request deadline. Its 600-second fallback default applies to that command invocation, not to ordinary Gateway turns; see [`openclaw agent`](/cli/agent).

### Claude CLI specifics

The bundled Anthropic plugin communicates directly with the installed Claude Code
executable over its structured stdio protocol. Claude Code owns its existing local login and
subscription. OpenClaw uses a non-secret route marker. It never reads, persists,
refreshes, or forwards native tokens, or sends synthesized Anthropic API
requests. Compatible agent turns share one warm Claude Code subprocess.
A changed model, system prompt, or tool policy starts a
new subprocess; persisted Claude session IDs still provide
conversation continuity when the gateway or subprocess restarts.

For local plugin-managed turns, prompt-build hook context stays private: Claude
receives it as a native hook attachment, while OpenClaw history preserves the original user message. The
native session retains the context for resume; imported visible history and
cross-provider fallback preludes do not copy private hook attachments.

Keep Claude Code updated, especially if OpenClaw reports an incompatible
installed executable:

```bash
claude --version
claude update
# Restart the OpenClaw gateway after updating.
```

The bundled `claude-cli` backend prefers Claude Code's native skill resolver. When the current skills snapshot has at least one selected skill with a materialized path, OpenClaw passes a temporary Claude Code plugin via `--plugin-dir` and omits the duplicate OpenClaw skills catalog from the appended system prompt. Without a materialized plugin skill, OpenClaw keeps the prompt catalog as a fallback. Skill env/API key overrides still apply to the child process environment for the run.

OpenClaw always launches Claude Code with its default permission mode.
OpenClaw's permission responses and `PreToolUse` hook keep native tools under
host control, including when user or enterprise settings would otherwise
preapprove a call. Native requests pass through canonical `before_tool_call`
policy before exec policy and approval, with native tool names and file
arguments projected into their OpenClaw equivalents. Per-agent and session
restrictions still override broader global policy. OpenClaw-owned MCP tools
remain authorized by the Gateway rather than receiving duplicate native
approval; other MCP tools stay host-permission controlled.

Claude's native `AskUserQuestion` uses OpenClaw's structured question flow. When
OpenClaw rejects malformed questions, it reports the failed field and
constraint without repeating the submitted text, and asks Claude to correct
the field and retry. Invalid questions do not prompt the user. If the user
skips a valid question, Claude instead continues with its best judgment.

When the effective exec ask setting is `on-miss` or `always`, OpenClaw relays
native or extension tool requests as interactive approvals to the session's
channel: **Allow once** permits the single call, **Allow always** permits that
tool name for the same warm live session while each subsequent turn's policy
and available tools still allow it, and **Deny**, a timeout, an unreachable
approval route, or a closed turn all deny the call. Grants stay in memory, end
when that exact live session is replaced, and never apply to Bash. Policies
that never prompt keep their existing behavior: `security: "deny"` rejects
every request, and ask `off` with less than full security denies without asking.

### Claude browser tools and 1Password sign-in

Claude Code can drive a Chrome browser through the [Claude in Chrome extension](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome), including [1Password for Claude](/gateway/1password#browser-sign-in-with-1password-for-claude) credential autofill. The bundled backend does not enable it; register a [CLI backend plugin](/plugins/cli-backend-plugins) that appends `--chrome` to the launch args of a `claude-stream-json`-dialect backend. OpenClaw preserves a configured `--chrome` on normal runs and always forces `--no-chrome` on runs with a restricted tool policy, such as side questions. The Chrome window, the extension, and any 1Password approval prompts live on the gateway host, so someone must be at that machine to approve credential use.

The backend maps OpenClaw `/think` levels to Claude Code's native `--effort` flag: `minimal`/`low` -> `low`, `medium` -> `medium`, and `high`/`xhigh`/`max` pass through directly. For models that allow fixed thinking budgets, it also launches Claude Code with `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`: `off=0`, `minimal=1024`, `low=2048`, `medium=8192`, `high`/`xhigh=16384`, and `max=32768`; positive fixed budgets disable adaptive thinking. Models that require adaptive thinking omit the fixed budget and continue to use `--effort`. `adaptive` removes configured effort flags and fixed-budget environment overrides, so Claude Code resolves effective thinking from its own environment, settings, and model defaults. Other CLI backends need their owning plugin to map the selected level before `/think` affects the spawned CLI.

Before OpenClaw can use `claude-cli`, Claude Code itself must be logged in on the same host:

```bash
claude auth login
claude auth status --text
openclaw models auth login --provider anthropic --method cli --set-default
```

Docker installs need Claude Code installed and logged in inside the persisted container home, not only on the host; see [Claude CLI backend in Docker](/install/docker#claude-cli-backend-in-docker).

The gateway service must resolve `claude` on `PATH`. For a nonstandard path,
register a small wrapper backend plugin.

## Sessions

- If the CLI supports sessions, set `sessionArgs` with a `{sessionId}` placeholder (for example `["--session-id", "{sessionId}"]`).
- If the CLI uses a resume subcommand with different flags, set `resumeArgs` (replaces `args` when resuming) and optionally `resumeOutput` for non-JSON resumes.
- `sessionMode`:
  - `always`: always send a session id (new UUID if none stored).
  - `existing`: only send a session id if one was stored before.
  - `none`: never send a session id.
- `claude-cli` defaults to `liveSession: "claude-stdio"`, `output: "jsonl"`, and `input: "stdin"`. The owning Anthropic plugin keeps one Claude Code subprocess warm for compatible consecutive agent turns through its direct CLI transport. If the gateway restarts or the idle process exits, OpenClaw resumes from the stored Claude session id. Stored session ids are verified against a readable project transcript before resume; a missing transcript clears the binding (logged as `reason=transcript-missing`) instead of silently starting a fresh session under `--resume`.
- Stored CLI sessions are provider-owned continuity. Automatic reset is disabled by default; `/reset` and explicit daily or idle `session.reset` policies still cut them.
- Fresh CLI sessions can recover OpenClaw history from the canonical session SQLite database when its independent account boundary matches the selected credential. Compacted recovery includes the latest summary, retained messages, and subsequent turns on the active branch. A backend can opt in to bounded recovery before compaction with `reseedFromRawTranscriptWhenUncompacted: true`, including after its native session binding is cleared. Recovery includes saved tool-result text and error markers; it does not execute past tools. The current user turn is sent once, outside the recovered history.
- Helper runs with a caller-owned in-memory transcript use that history for hooks and fresh-session reseeding, including meaningful history before compaction. Empty memory stays empty even when the run carries another session's storage identity. Context-engine maintenance rewrites that same memory before the helper returns, even when the engine requests background maintenance. Durable transcripts retain their background maintenance path. An explicitly owned native CLI binding can still resume; resumed turns send the current prompt without injecting the memory history again.

### History account boundaries

Native session compatibility and permission to replay saved OpenClaw history are separate. Clearing or replacing a native binding does not establish ownership of older transcript rows. OpenClaw records a private account fingerprint and contiguous transcript coverage before an admitted CLI turn, then advances coverage with that turn’s canonical writes. It never stores credential values in this metadata.

Automatic durable recovery requires a resolved static credential or a named OAuth account. Opaque CLI logins, identity-less OAuth credentials, legacy transcripts without provenance, imported or otherwise unaccounted content, and incompatible provenance versions cannot authorize automatic replay. Native resume remains available under the backend’s existing rules. Switching accounts makes mixed history ineligible even after a successful replacement, a later clear, or a switch back to the original account. A new session or an empty reset can establish a new boundary; a reset that retains messages cannot relabel them.

This uses existing session metadata and transcript generation/sequence counters; no SQLite schema migration or transcript deletion occurs. Existing conversations are not backfilled from their latest native binding. Older binaries do not enforce this new recovery boundary. After a downgrade and subsequent transcript writes, upgrading again refuses automatic replay because those writes are not covered. Do not rely on a downgrade to preserve the new security behavior.

Explicit caller-owned in-memory context remains caller-supplied input, not permission to read a durable conversation carrying the same identifiers. Authentication invalidations still refuse its recovery prompt. When automatic recovery is refused, the saved transcript remains intact; the next CLI process receives the current request without the saved history.

Serialization: `serialize: true` keeps same-lane runs ordered (most CLIs serialize on one provider lane). OpenClaw also drops stored CLI session reuse when the selected auth identity changes, including a changed auth profile id, static API key, static token, or OAuth account identity when the CLI exposes one; OAuth access/refresh token rotation alone does not cut the session. If a CLI has no stable OAuth account id, OpenClaw lets that CLI enforce its own resume permissions.

## Fallback prelude from claude-cli sessions

When a `claude-cli` attempt fails over to a non-CLI candidate in [`agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`](/concepts/model-failover), OpenClaw seeds the next attempt with a context prelude harvested from Claude Code's local JSONL transcript (under `~/.claude/projects/`, keyed per workspace). This supplies CLI-owned context that may not be present in OpenClaw's SQLite session transcript.

- The prelude prefers the latest `/compact` summary or `compact_boundary` marker, then appends the most recent post-boundary turns up to a char budget. Pre-boundary turns are dropped because the summary already represents them.
- Tool blocks are coalesced to compact `(tool call: name)` and `(tool result: …)` hints to keep the prompt budget honest; an oversized summary is truncated and labeled `(truncated)`.
- Same-provider `claude-cli` to `claude-cli` fallbacks rely on Claude's own `--resume` and skip the prelude.
- The seed reuses the existing Claude session-file path validation, so arbitrary paths cannot be read.

## Images

Plugin authors declare image-path support with `imageArg`:

```json5
imageArg: "--image",
imageMode: "repeat"
```

OpenClaw writes base64 images to temp files. If `imageArg` is set, those paths are passed as CLI args; if not, OpenClaw appends the file paths to the prompt (path injection), which works for CLIs that auto-load local files from plain paths.

## Inputs and outputs

- `output: "text"` (default) treats stdout as the final response.
- `output: "json"` tries to parse JSON and extract text plus a session id.
- `output: "jsonl"` parses a JSONL stream and extracts the final agent message plus session identifiers when present.
- For Gemini CLI JSON output, OpenClaw reads reply text from `response` and usage from `stats` when `usage` is missing or empty. The bundled Gemini CLI adapter uses `stream-json`.

JSON examples inside double-quoted banner text are not treated as response or error records.
For JSONL, banner scanning starts fresh on each line.

Input modes:

- `input: "arg"` (default) passes the prompt as the last CLI arg.
- `input: "stdin"` sends the prompt via stdin.
- If the prompt is very long and `maxPromptArgChars` is set, stdin is used instead.

## Plugin-owned defaults

CLI backend defaults are part of the plugin surface:

- Plugins register them with `api.registerCliBackend(...)`.
- The backend `id` becomes the provider prefix in model refs.
- Command, argv, environment, parser, session, and watchdog behavior stays in plugin code.
- Backend-specific normalization stays plugin-owned through the optional `normalizeConfig` hook.

Anthropic owns `claude-cli` and Google owns `google-gemini-cli`. OpenAI Codex agent runs use the Codex app-server harness through `openai/*`; OpenClaw no longer registers a bundled `codex-cli` backend.

The bundled Anthropic plugin registers for `claude-cli`:

On Claude Code 2.1.98 or newer, the bundled backend adds
`--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` after a bounded version probe on the
first CLI execution. Concurrent executions share the probe; API catalog discovery
does not start it. Older, unknown, or failed probes keep the established argv.

Prerequisites: the local Gemini CLI must be installed and on `PATH` as `gemini`
(`brew install gemini-cli` or `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`), and the
selected model must have a supported Google AI Studio API-key profile. Existing
valid legacy Gemini CLI OAuth profiles remain runtime-compatible, but OpenClaw
does not create or repair them.

Gemini CLI output notes:

- The default `stream-json` parser reads assistant `message` events, tool events, final `result` usage, and fatal Gemini error events.
- Usage falls back to `stats` when `usage` is absent or empty; `stats.cached` normalizes into OpenClaw `cacheRead`, and if `stats.input` is missing, input tokens derive from `stats.input_tokens - stats.cached`.

## Text transform overlays

Plugins that need small prompt/message compatibility shims can declare bidirectional text transforms without replacing a provider or CLI backend:

```typescript
api.registerTextTransforms({
  input: [{ from: /red basket/g, to: "blue basket" }],
  output: [{ from: /blue basket/g, to: "red basket" }],
});
```

`input` rewrites the system prompt and user prompt passed to the CLI. `output` rewrites streamed assistant text and parsed final text before OpenClaw handles its own control markers and channel delivery; for provider-backed model calls it also restores string values inside structured tool-call arguments after stream repair and before tool execution. Raw provider JSON fragments are left unchanged; consumers should use the structured partial, end, or result payload.

For CLIs that emit provider-specific JSONL events, set `jsonlDialect` on that backend's config: `claude-stream-json` for Claude Code-compatible streams, `gemini-stream-json` for Gemini CLI `stream-json` events. Declaring `claude-stream-json` is a contract: the backend's `result` records carry Claude Code's terminal semantics, including `terminal_reason`. A reply-less `result` whose `terminal_reason` says the CLI ended the turn on purpose after work may have run (`hook_stopped`, `stop_hook_prevented`, `aborted_tools`, `aborted_streaming`, `budget_exhausted`, or `max_turns`) is a recorded turn stop: OpenClaw reports that reason to the user and does not replay the turn on a fallback model, because the backend's tool actions may already have run.

## Native compaction ownership

Some CLI backends run an agent that compacts its own transcript, so OpenClaw must not run its safeguard summarizer against them — doing so fights the backend's own compaction and can hard-fail the turn.

`claude-cli` has no harness endpoint (Claude Code compacts internally), so it declares `ownsNativeCompaction: true`. Automatic OpenClaw compaction defers to Claude Code, while an explicit `/compact` resumes the bound Claude Code session and sends its native `/compact` command. OpenClaw passes the run's effective context budget through Claude Code's documented [`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars), keeping native auto-compaction aligned with configured Anthropic `contextTokens` limits. Native-harness sessions such as Codex keep routing to their harness compaction endpoint instead.

`google-gemini-cli` also owns automatic compaction and persists its compressed session for resume. OpenClaw defers to Gemini CLI rather than running a second summarizer. Explicit `/compact` is unsupported for this backend because it does not declare a manual compaction capability.

```typescript
api.registerCliBackend({
  id: "my-cli",
  ownsNativeCompaction: true,
  manualCompaction: {
    buildPrompt: (instructions) => (instructions ? `/compact ${instructions}` : "/compact"),
    input: "arg",
    validateOutput: (rawOutput) =>
      rawOutput.includes('"type":"compaction_complete"')
        ? { ok: true }
        : { ok: false, reason: "CLI did not confirm compaction." },
  },
  // ...
});
```

Only declare `ownsNativeCompaction` for a backend that genuinely owns compaction: it must reliably bound its own transcript near the context window and persist a resumable session (e.g. `--resume` / `--session-id`), or a deferred session can stay over budget.

Add the atomic `manualCompaction` capability only when its command compacts the resumed session in place. Its `input` selects the transport the backend command actually recognizes, and `validateOutput` must require a positive backend acknowledgement rather than treating a zero exit as success. OpenClaw runs it as an internal control operation: it is not written as a user turn and does not run agent or context-engine turn hooks.

## Bundle MCP overlays

CLI backends do not receive OpenClaw tool calls directly, but a backend can opt into a generated MCP config overlay with `bundleMcp: true`. Current bundled behavior:

- `claude-cli`: generated strict MCP config file.
- `google-gemini-cli`: generated Gemini system settings file.

When bundle MCP is enabled, OpenClaw:

- spawns a loopback HTTP MCP server that exposes gateway tools to the CLI process, authenticated with a per-run context grant (`OPENCLAW_MCP_TOKEN`) active only for the current execution attempt;
- binds tool access to the Gateway-selected session, account, and channel context instead of trusting child-process headers;
- loads enabled bundle-MCP servers for the current workspace and merges them with any existing backend MCP config/settings shape;
- rewrites the launch config using the backend-owned integration mode from the owning plugin.

The node-only `exec` tool is offered only when policy permits it and a connected
node advertises `system.run`. Offline paired devices and approval-only phones do
not make remote execution available. A configured node binding must identify an
eligible node; it never redirects to another device. When several eligible nodes
are connected, select one explicitly. When local execution is allowed by policy,
use the CLI's native shell for local work.

`tools.allow` and `tools.deny` also constrain configured native MCP servers.
OpenClaw lists each server through its session-scoped runtime, assigns the same
provider-safe `<safe-server>__<safe-tool>` identities used by embedded tools,
and applies the complete layered policy before process spawn or Codex
`thread/start`/`thread/resume`. It then projects exact raw names into each
backend's enforcement contract: Claude receives server omission plus bare
`--disallowedTools` entries, Codex receives `enabled_tools` and
`disabled_tools`, and Gemini receives `includeTools` and `excludeTools`.
Configured server filters and session overrides remain additional
restrictions. These backend fields are generated implementation details; keep
operator policy in OpenClaw configuration.

For example, `agents.entries.research.tools.allow: ["docs__read_docs"]`
exposes only that tool from the safe `docs` namespace, while
`deny: ["docs__delete_*"]` removes matching siblings. An empty intersection
omits the affected MCP server. A server whose restrictive catalog cannot be
established is also omitted and reported instead of being passed through
unfiltered.

Restricted runs such as cron jobs with `toolsAllow` require an exact
backend-owned translation. The bundled `claude-cli` backend disables Claude's
native tools and user, project, and local customizations, including hooks,
plugins, agents, skills, and `CLAUDE.md`. It then exposes every allowed
OpenClaw tool through the grant-scoped MCP server. This keeps filesystem,
process, exec, approval, and sandbox policy inside OpenClaw instead of widening
authority to Claude's native tools or customization processes. The same MCP
list is enforced in Claude's generated config and again by the Gateway on tool
listing and execution. Before minting the grant, core rejects backend
translations that name any MCP permission outside the original allowlist.
Backends without an exact translation still fail closed.

If no MCP servers are enabled, OpenClaw still injects a strict config when a backend opts into bundle MCP, so background runs stay isolated.

Session-scoped bundled MCP runtimes are cached for reuse within a session, then reaped after 10 minutes of idle time. One-shot embedded runs such as auth probes, slug generation, and active-memory recall request cleanup at run end so stdio children and Streamable HTTP/SSE streams do not outlive the run.

A fresh CLI session must wait for its predecessor's cleanup. If cleanup fails or
exceeds its deadline, OpenClaw refuses replacement, including from a later run.
Check the cleanup error and the backend's remaining processes before retrying.
Command output and process exit alone do not confirm that descendants stopped.

For `claude-cli`, the installed Claude Code process uses its current native
login. OpenClaw uses a non-secret route marker and never reads, persists,
refreshes, selects, or forwards the native tokens.
Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` on the Gateway process to use a separate Claude configuration directory.
Explicit OpenClaw-managed API-key and token profiles continue to use the
protected, per-invocation credential-forwarding CLI path.

## Reseed history cap

When a fresh CLI session is seeded from a prior OpenClaw transcript (for example after a `session_expired` retry), the rendered `<conversation_history>` block is capped to keep reseed prompts from exploding. The default is 12,288 characters (about 3,000 tokens).

Claude CLI backends scale this cap with the resolved Claude context window instead: larger context windows get a larger prior-history slice, up to a fixed ceiling; other CLI backends keep the conservative default. This cap only governs the reseed prompt's prior-history block.

## Limitations

- OpenClaw does not inject tool calls into the CLI backend protocol. Backends only see gateway tools when they opt into `bundleMcp: true`.
- Streaming is backend-specific: some backends stream JSONL, others buffer until exit.
- Structured outputs depend on the CLI's own JSON format.

## Troubleshooting

When a local Claude Code subprocess fails, its run error includes a bounded,
redacted stderr diagnostic when available. Check the run error or `openclaw logs`
for the underlying launch, permission, or runtime failure. Successful turns do not
forward stderr into logs. Each live process has its own diagnostic buffer. Since
stderr has no turn identifiers, a warm process's failure can include earlier turns;
the error labels that output as process-wide rather than attributing it to the failing turn.
Oversized incomplete lines are omitted so truncation cannot expose credential
fragments. Native stdout and MCP input are not included in these diagnostics.
Stderr is supplemental display text only; it does not change the native error's
retry, authentication, timeout, or fallback classification.

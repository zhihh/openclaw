This page covers step-by-step onboarding behavior, outputs, and internals.
For a walkthrough, see [Onboarding (CLI)](/start/wizard). For the full CLI flag
reference (every `--flag`, non-interactive examples, provider-specific
commands), see [`openclaw onboard`](/cli/onboard).

## What the wizard does

Fresh local guided onboarding shows a one-line pointer to the
[security guide](/gateway/security) and one choice: **Quick start** or
**Custom setup**. Quick start records the security acknowledgment; Custom setup
shows the full security note and asks for confirmation. Quick start reuses
detected AI access, verifies it, saves config, and opens the web
dashboard with a foreground Gateway. It uses agent name `main` and full access,
leaves telemetry consent unset, and skips route confirmation, memory import,
and app recommendations. **Ctrl+C** stops the Gateway without removing config;
`openclaw gateway install` enables background operation later.

Custom setup keeps the full guided prompts. If quick start finds no usable
route, it continues with manual provider setup and the remaining guided steps,
including Gateway service installation. The quick-start defaults for agent name
(`main`), access mode (full access), and telemetry (consent unset) stay.
See [Guided default](/start/wizard#guided-default).

The classic wizard (`openclaw onboard --classic`) in local mode walks you through:

- Workspace location and bootstrap files
- Model and auth setup (Anthropic, OpenAI Code subscription OAuth, xAI, OpenCode, custom endpoints, and more provider-owned auth flows)
- Gateway settings (port, bind, auth, Tailscale)
- Channels and providers (Discord, Feishu, Google Chat, iMessage, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams, QQ Bot, Signal, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, and other bundled or plugin channels)
- Web search provider (optional)
- Skills setup
- Daemon install (LaunchAgent, systemd user unit, or native Windows Scheduled Task with Startup-folder fallback)
- Health check

Remote mode configures this machine to connect to a Gateway elsewhere. It does
not install or modify anything on the remote host.

## Local flow details

These steps describe the classic wizard. The guided quick-start lane is
described [above](/start/wizard-cli-reference#what-the-wizard-does).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup mode">
    - With no configured default model, the menu contains **QuickStart
      (recommended)** (default) followed by **Manual setup**.
    - With a configured default model, **Keep existing model config** appears
      first and becomes the default, followed by **QuickStart (recommended)**
      and **Manual setup**.
      An explicit non-`skip` `--auth-choice` or a single provider credential
      flag still configures that provider without changing the existing default
      model, unless the provider requires you to select a model. Multiple
      provider flags require an explicit `--auth-choice`.
    - When a migration provider is available, **Import from another agent**
      appears after those setup choices. Selecting it opens a provider list
      with entries such as **Import from Claude**, **Import from Codex**, and
      **Import from Hermes**. Detected sources appear first with their paths;
      other available providers ask for a source path. Explicit import flags
      dispatch the import directly and skip this menu. Use Back from the
      provider list to return to **Setup mode** before an import begins.
    - Re-running the wizard does not wipe anything unless you pass `--reset`.
      Reset is a command flag, not a setup-mode choice.
    - `--reset-scope` accepts `config` (config only),
      `config+creds+sessions` (default), or `full` (also removes the workspace).
      Before moving state to Trash, the command
      validates TTY availability and rejectable CLI options. Non-interactive
      setup also requires `--accept-risk` before reset. Interactive classic
      setup performs reset before showing its risk acknowledgement; declining
      that prompt does not undo the reset.
    - Migration import options (`--flow import`, `--import-from`,
      `--import-source`, and `--import-secrets`) cannot be combined with
      `--reset`; run the import without `--reset`.
    - Without `--reset`, invalid config or legacy keys stop the wizard and ask
      you to run `openclaw doctor` before continuing.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Risk acknowledgment">
    - The first run asks you to acknowledge that agents are powerful and full
      system access is risky. The wizard stores the acknowledgment in
      `wizard.securityAcknowledgedAt`, so reruns do not ask again.
    - Interactive runs show a confirmation prompt; declining cancels setup.
    - `--non-interactive` requires `--accept-risk` and exits with an error when
      the flag is missing.
    - Interactive classic setup performs `--reset` before this prompt. Declining
      after a reset does not restore state already moved to Trash.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Workspace">
    - Default `~/.openclaw/workspace` (configurable).
    - Seeds workspace files needed for first-run bootstrap.
    - On rerun, an existing agent roster keeps its fleet-wide workspace unless
      you explicitly confirm the move. Non-interactive reruns warn and preserve
      the current value.
    - Workspace layout: [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Model and auth">
    - Full option matrix is in [Auth and model options](#auth-and-model-options).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Gateway">
    - Prompts for port, bind, auth mode, and Tailscale exposure.
    - Recommended: keep token auth enabled even for loopback so local WS clients must authenticate.
    - In token mode, interactive setup offers:
      - **Generate/store plaintext token** (default)
      - **Use SecretRef** (opt-in)
      - QuickStart reuses an existing `gateway.auth.token` SecretRef from an
        `env`, `file`, `exec`, or `store` provider for its probe and dashboard
        handoff. An unresolved configured ref stops onboarding with remediation
        guidance instead of silently weakening Gateway auth.
    - In password mode, interactive setup also supports plaintext or SecretRef storage.
    - Non-interactive token SecretRef path: `--gateway-token-ref-env <ENV_VAR>`.
      - Requires a non-empty env var in the onboarding process environment.
      - Cannot be combined with `--gateway-token`.
    - Disable auth only if you fully trust every local process.
    - Non-loopback binds still require auth.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Channels">
    - [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp): optional QR login
    - [Telegram](/channels/telegram): bot token
    - [Discord](/channels/discord): bot token
    - [Google Chat](/channels/googlechat): service account JSON + webhook audience
    - [Mattermost](/channels/mattermost): bot token + base URL
    - [Signal](/channels/signal): optional `signal-cli` install + account config
    - [iMessage](/channels/imessage): `imsg` CLI path + Messages DB access; use an SSH wrapper when the Gateway runs off-Mac
    - Other bundled or separately installed channel plugins can add their own
      onboarding steps. See the complete [channel catalog](/channels).
    - DM security: default is pairing. First DM sends a code; approve via
      `openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code>` or use allowlists.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Web search">
    - Pick a provider (Brave, Codex Hosted Search, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Firecrawl,
      Gemini, Grok, Kimi, MiniMax Search, Ollama Web Search, Parallel,
      Perplexity, SearXNG, or Tavily) or skip.
    - Skip this step with `--skip-search`; reconfigure later with `openclaw configure --section web`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Skills">
    - Reads available skills and checks requirements.
    - Lets you choose node manager: npm, pnpm, or bun.
    - Installs optional dependencies for trusted bundled skills when the required
      installer is available.
    - Skips unavailable Homebrew, uv, and Go installers, then groups the affected
      skills with manual setup guidance. Run `openclaw doctor` after installing
      the missing prerequisites.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Daemon install">
    - macOS: LaunchAgent
      - Requires logged-in user session; for headless, use a custom LaunchDaemon (not shipped).
    - Linux and Windows via WSL2: systemd user unit
      - Wizard attempts `loginctl enable-linger <user>` so gateway stays up after logout.
      - May prompt for sudo (writes `/var/lib/systemd/linger`); it tries without sudo first.
    - Native Windows: Scheduled Task first
      - If task creation is denied, OpenClaw falls back to a per-user Startup-folder login item and starts the gateway immediately.
      - Scheduled Tasks remain preferred because they provide better supervisor status.
    - Runtime selection: Node is the primary, default, and recommended runtime. Bun 1.4+ with WAL-reset-safe `node:sqlite` is available as an explicit opt-in.
    - A SecretRef-managed `gateway.auth.token` is validated without copying its
      resolved plaintext value into supervisor service metadata. An unresolved
      token ref blocks daemon installation with remediation guidance.
    - If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` exist while
      `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, daemon installation blocks until you choose
      a mode explicitly.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Health check">
    - Starts gateway (if needed) and runs `openclaw health`.
    - `openclaw status --deep` adds the live gateway health probe to status output, including channel probes when supported.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish">
    - Summary and next steps, including iOS, Android, and macOS app options.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If no GUI is detected, the wizard prints SSH port-forward instructions for the Control UI instead of opening a browser.
If Control UI assets are missing, the wizard attempts to build them; fallback is `pnpm ui:build` (auto-installs UI deps).
</Note>

## Remote mode details

Remote mode configures this machine to connect to a Gateway elsewhere. It does
not install or modify anything on the remote host.

What you set:

- Remote gateway URL (`ws://...` or `wss://...`)
- Token, password, or no auth, matching the remote Gateway's configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery (optional)">
    If `dns-sd` (macOS) or `avahi-browse` (Linux) is available, onboarding
    offers to search for Bonjour/mDNS gateway beacons before falling back to
    manual URL entry. Wide-area DNS-SD discovery is also attempted when
    configured. Docs: [Gateway discovery](/gateway/discovery), [Bonjour](/gateway/bonjour).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connection method">
    When a beacon is selected, choose direct WebSocket or an SSH tunnel:
    - **Direct**: connects over `wss://` and prompts to trust the discovered
      TLS fingerprint (trust-on-first-use pinning; only pinned if you accept).
    - **SSH tunnel**: prints an `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 <user>@<host>`
      command to run first, then connects to the local tunnel endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auth">
    Choose token (recommended), password, or no auth, then optionally store it
    as a SecretRef instead of plaintext.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the gateway is loopback-only and not discoverable, use SSH tunneling or a tailnet manually.
Plaintext `ws://` is accepted for loopback, private IP literals, `.local`, and Tailnet `*.ts.net` URLs; other private-DNS names need `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1`.
</Note>

## Auth and model options

If a provider setup step fails in interactive onboarding (for example a CLI reuse option
without a local sign-in), the wizard shows the error and returns to the provider picker
instead of exiting. Explicit `--auth-choice` runs still fail fast for automation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anthropic API key">
    Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if present or prompts for a key, then saves it for daemon use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Anthropic Claude CLI">
    Preferred local path in interactive onboarding/configure; reuses an existing Claude CLI sign-in when available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Anthropic setup token">
    Supports the long-lived token created by `claude setup-token`. Choose
    **Anthropic setup-token** during onboarding, or manage it later with
    [`openclaw models auth`](/cli/models#auth-profiles).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI Code subscription (OAuth)">
    Browser flow; paste `code#state`.

    On a fresh setup with no primary model, sets `agents.defaults.model` to
    `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` through the Codex runtime.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI Code subscription (device pairing)">
    Browser pairing flow with a short-lived device code.

    On a fresh setup with no primary model, sets `agents.defaults.model` to
    `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` through the Codex runtime.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI API key">
    Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` if present or prompts for a key, then stores the credential in auth profiles.

    On a fresh setup with no primary model, sets `agents.defaults.model` to
    `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`. The bare direct-API `openai/gpt-5.6` alias remains
    supported and resolves to the same tier.

    Adding or reauthenticating OpenAI preserves an existing explicit primary
    model, including `openai/gpt-5.5`. If the account does not expose GPT-5.6,
    select `openai/gpt-5.5` explicitly; OpenClaw does not silently downgrade it.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="xAI (Grok) OAuth">
    Browser sign-in for eligible SuperGrok or X Premium accounts. This is the
    recommended xAI path for most users. OpenClaw stores the resulting auth
    profile for Grok models, Grok `web_search`, `x_search`, and `code_execution`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="xAI (Grok) device code">
    Remote-friendly browser sign-in with a short code instead of a localhost
    callback. Use this from SSH, Docker, or VPS hosts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="xAI (Grok) API key">
    Prompts for `XAI_API_KEY` and configures xAI as a model provider. Use this
    when you want an xAI Console API key instead of subscription OAuth.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenCode">
    Prompts for `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (or `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY`) and lets you choose the Zen or Go catalog (one API key covers both).
    Setup URL: [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API key (generic)">
    Stores the key for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vercel AI Gateway">
    Prompts for `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.
    More detail: [Vercel AI Gateway](/providers/vercel-ai-gateway).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cloudflare AI Gateway">
    Prompts for account ID, gateway ID, and `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.
    More detail: [Cloudflare AI Gateway](/providers/cloudflare-ai-gateway).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MiniMax">
    Config is auto-written. Hosted default is `MiniMax-M3`; API-key setup uses
    `minimax/...`, and OAuth setup uses `minimax-portal/...`.
    More detail: [MiniMax](/providers/minimax).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="StepFun">
    Config is auto-written for StepFun standard or Step Plan on China or global endpoints.
    Standard currently includes `step-3.5-flash`, and Step Plan also includes `step-3.5-flash-2603`.
    More detail: [StepFun](/providers/stepfun).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Synthetic (Anthropic-compatible)">
    Prompts for `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY`.
    More detail: [Synthetic](/providers/synthetic).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ollama (Cloud and local open models)">
    Prompts for `Cloud + Local`, `Cloud only`, or `Local only` first.
    `Cloud only` uses `OLLAMA_API_KEY` with `https://ollama.com`.
    The host-backed modes prompt for base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`), discover available models, and suggest defaults.
    `Cloud + Local` also checks whether that Ollama host is signed in for cloud access.
    More detail: [Ollama](/providers/ollama).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moonshot and Kimi Coding">
    Moonshot (Kimi K2) and Kimi Coding configs are auto-written.
    More detail: [Moonshot AI (Kimi + Kimi Coding)](/providers/moonshot).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom provider">
    Works with OpenAI-compatible, OpenAI Responses-compatible, and Anthropic-compatible endpoints.

    Interactive onboarding supports the same API key storage choices as other provider API key flows:
    - **Paste API key now** (plaintext)
    - **Use secret reference** (env ref or configured provider ref, with preflight validation)

    Onboarding infers image support for common vision model IDs (GPT-4o/4.1/5.x, Claude 3/4, Gemini, Qwen-VL, LLaVA, Pixtral, and similar) and only asks when the model name is unknown.

    Non-interactive flags:
    - `--auth-choice custom-api-key`
    - `--custom-base-url`
    - `--custom-model-id`
    - `--custom-api-key` (optional; falls back to `CUSTOM_API_KEY`)
    - `--custom-provider-id` (optional)
    - `--custom-compatibility <openai|openai-responses|anthropic>` (optional; default `openai`)
    - `--custom-image-input` / `--custom-text-input` (optional; override inferred model input capability)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Skip">
    Leaves auth unconfigured.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Model behavior:

- Pick default model from detected options, or enter provider and model manually.
- When onboarding starts from a provider auth choice, the model picker prefers
  that provider automatically. For Volcengine and BytePlus, the same preference
  also matches their coding-plan variants (`volcengine-plan/*`,
  `byteplus-plan/*`).
- If that preferred-provider filter would be empty, the picker falls back to
  the full catalog instead of showing no models.
- Wizard runs a model check and warns if the configured model is unknown or missing auth.

Credential and profile paths:

- Agent-local auth profiles (API keys, tokens, and OAuth): `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite` (`auth_profile_store`).
- Shared auth profiles: `~/.openclaw/state/openclaw.sqlite`; agent-local profiles override this read-through base. Older installs keep the shared store in the main agent's database until `openclaw doctor --fix` relocates it.
- Legacy import only: `auth-profiles.json`, per-agent `auth.json`, and `~/.openclaw/credentials/oauth.json`. Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to import them into SQLite; new logins do not write these files.

Paths respect `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`. See [Auth credential semantics](/auth-credential-semantics#agent-copy-portability) for shared-store and agent-local behavior.

Credential storage mode:

- Default onboarding behavior persists API keys as plaintext values in auth profiles.
- `--secret-input-mode ref` enables reference mode instead of plaintext key storage.
  In interactive setup, you can choose either:
  - environment variable ref (for example `keyRef: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "OPENAI_API_KEY" }`)
  - configured provider ref (`file` or `exec`) with provider alias + id
- Interactive reference mode runs a fast preflight validation before saving.
  - Env refs: validates variable name + non-empty value in the current onboarding environment.
  - Provider refs: validates provider config and resolves the requested id.
  - If preflight fails, onboarding shows the error and lets you retry.
- In non-interactive mode, `--secret-input-mode ref` creates only env-backed references for new credentials.
  - Set the provider env var in the onboarding process environment when adding a new credential.
  - Inline key flags (for example `--openai-api-key`) require that env var to be set; otherwise onboarding fails fast.
  - Existing resolvable named auth profiles are reused unchanged, including existing `env`, `file`, `exec`, and `store` references; no new `apiKey` or `keyRef` is written and no additional provider env var is required.
  - For new custom-provider credentials, non-interactive `ref` mode stores `models.providers.<id>.apiKey` as `{ source: "env", provider: "default", id: "CUSTOM_API_KEY" }`.
  - In that custom-provider case, `--custom-api-key` requires `CUSTOM_API_KEY` to be set; otherwise onboarding fails fast.
  - Existing plaintext profile credentials remain unchanged; reference mode does not migrate them. Run `openclaw secrets configure --apply`, then `openclaw secrets audit --check`. See [Secrets management](/gateway/secrets).
- Gateway auth credentials support plaintext and SecretRef choices in interactive setup:
  - Token mode: **Generate/store plaintext token** (default) or **Use SecretRef**.
  - Password mode: plaintext or SecretRef.
- Non-interactive token SecretRef path: `--gateway-token-ref-env <ENV_VAR>`.
- The named environment variable must be non-empty in the onboarding process.
  `--gateway-token` and `--gateway-token-ref-env` are mutually exclusive.
- Existing plaintext setups continue to work unchanged.

## Headless and server setup

Run auth setup **on the Gateway host**, using the same OS user and state directory
as the Gateway. Over SSH, use an interactive terminal:

```bash
openclaw configure --section model
```

Choose your provider's supported auth method. For a browser OAuth flow, open the
displayed URL in your local browser and paste the redirect URL or authorization
code back into the terminal on the Gateway host when prompted. If the provider
offers device-code login, complete the displayed URL/code in your local browser
while the Gateway host's login process waits. The completed login persists the
credential on that host in SQLite; no credential file handoff is needed.

For a specific agent, run `openclaw models auth login --provider <id> --agent <agentId>`
on the Gateway host. See [Models CLI](/cli/models#auth-profiles) and
[OAuth](/concepts/oauth).

For unattended setup, use a provider API key with
[non-interactive onboarding](/cli/onboard#non-interactive-setup). If you use
`--secret-input-mode ref`, make the referenced environment variable available to
the Gateway service as well as the onboarding process. See
[Authentication](/gateway/authentication).

Verify the result on the Gateway host with `openclaw models status` (add
`--agent <agentId>` for a specific agent). Remote-client onboarding only configures
the local client connection; it does not set up provider credentials on the server.
Do not copy `auth-profiles.json` or replace a SQLite database to transfer a login.

## Outputs and internals

Typical fields in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

- `agents.defaults.workspace`
- `agents.defaults.skipBootstrap` when `--skip-bootstrap` is passed
- `agents.defaults.model` and provider config when the selected provider needs it
- `tools.profile` (local onboarding defaults to `"coding"` when unset; existing explicit values are preserved)
- `gateway.*` (mode, bind, auth, tailscale)
- `session.dmScope` (onboarding preserves explicit values and otherwise leaves it unset, so the `main` default keeps all direct messages across channels in the agent's rolling main session—the personal-agent default. For shared or multi-user inboxes, use `per-channel-peer`; `openclaw security audit` recommends isolation when it detects multi-user DM traffic)
- `channels.telegram.botToken`, `channels.discord.token`, `channels.matrix.*`, `channels.signal.*`, `channels.imessage.*`
- Channel allowlists when you opt in during prompts. Discord, Matrix,
  Microsoft Teams, and Slack resolve names to IDs when possible; other channels
  accept their native IDs directly.
- `skills.install.nodeManager`
  - The `setup --node-manager` flag accepts `npm`, `pnpm`, or `bun`.
  - Manual config can still set `skills.install.nodeManager: "yarn"` later.
- `wizard.lastRunAt`
- `wizard.lastRunVersion`
- `wizard.lastRunCommit`
- `wizard.lastRunCommand`
- `wizard.lastRunMode`
- `wizard.securityAcknowledgedAt`

`openclaw agents add` writes `agents.entries.*` and optional `bindings`.

WhatsApp credentials go under `~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/`.
Active sessions and transcripts are stored in
`~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite`. The
`~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/` directory is used for legacy migration
inputs and archive/support artifacts.

<Note>
Some channels are delivered as plugins. When selected during setup, the wizard
prompts to install the plugin (npm or local path) before channel configuration.
</Note>

### Installed app recommendations

After the model access check succeeds, classic interactive onboarding on macOS scans application names and bundle IDs without requesting macOS privacy permissions. It searches the official plugin catalogs and ClawHub, then asks the configured model to reject false name matches and recommend relevant plugins or skills. Recommended matches are selected by default; optional matches require an explicit selection.

The results screen lists the detected applications and shows: "App names were matched using your configured model and ClawHub search." Set `wizard.appRecommendations` to `false` to disable both this onboarding step and Gateway access to node app inventories. The scan is not used in quickstart or non-macOS onboarding.

## Non-interactive setup

`--non-interactive` requires `--accept-risk` (acknowledges that agents are
powerful and full system access is risky):

```bash
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --accept-risk --skip-health \
  --auth-choice apiKey \
  --anthropic-api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

`--mode` defaults to `local`. `--json` changes output format but does not imply
non-interactive mode. For complete flag semantics and Gateway SecretRef
examples, see [`openclaw onboard`](/cli/onboard). Provider-specific scripts live
in [CLI automation](/start/wizard-cli-automation).

## Gateway wizard RPC

- `wizard.start`
- `wizard.next`
- `wizard.cancel`
- `wizard.status`

Clients (macOS app and Control UI) can render steps without re-implementing onboarding logic.

When setup admission is busy, `wizard.start` and the model setup start/activation
methods return `UNAVAILABLE` with `details.code: "SETUP_ADMISSION_BUSY"`. This
means that the requested operation did not begin: clients can retire that attempt
and allow an explicit retry after the competing setup finishes. A terminal wizard
`error` also ends that operation, but does not imply that earlier writes were
rolled back. Generic request failures, timeouts, disconnects, and a missing wizard
do not establish whether setup ran; clients must preserve that uncertainty rather
than automatically retrying or claiming successful activation.

## Signal setup behavior

- Downloads the appropriate release asset from the official `signal-cli` GitHub releases (native build, Linux x86-64 only)
- On other platforms (macOS, non-x64 Linux), installs via Homebrew instead
- Stores the release-asset install under `~/.openclaw/tools/signal-cli/<version>/`
- Writes `channels.signal.transport.cliPath` with `kind: "managed-native"` in config
- Native Windows is not supported yet; run onboarding inside WSL2 to get the Linux install path

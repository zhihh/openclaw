---

Every thread in the Control UI can own a **dashboard** — a grid of live widgets
your agent builds for you. Choose **Dashboard** in the side panel to open the
current task's board, even before it has widgets. This leaves your chat draft
unchanged. When its first widget is pinned, the dashboard opens beside the
conversation in a resizable side panel, unless you have already chosen a layout
for that task. Use the task toolbar's **Swap** button to exchange the dashboard and
chat, or its **Layout** menu to move the side panel left, right, or below the
main area. Later widget updates leave your current panel layout unchanged.
Closing and reopening the panel does not restart loaded widgets or discard their
unsaved input. Reloading the page starts fresh widget views.

There is nothing to set up and no separate app to configure: dashboards are a
core feature, owned by the thread, stored with the agent, and they survive
`/new` and `/reset` (the conversation context clears; the board stays).

## Find your dashboards

Open `/dashboards` to browse dashboard-enabled threads as a card gallery. Search
by thread or author, filter by author, and sort by recent activity or title.
Select a card to open its owning task with the dashboard as the focused main
view. Choose **Restore split** to bring the side panel alongside it. An open
Dashboards page updates as threads are renamed, archived, or deleted, including
after a Gateway reconnect.
If a refresh fails, the page keeps the last loaded dashboards visible with a
stale-data warning. Choose **Retry** to load the list again.

The dashboard and its server-side thread preference follow you when you connect
to the same Gateway from another device. The active dashboard tab and task
layout remain per-device UI state. Ordinary task revisits restore the browser's
saved arrangement for that task; opening a gallery card explicitly focuses the
dashboard.

## Arrange your task

The main area and side panel can show either the dashboard or chat. Browser,
Terminal, Files, and Review use the same layout controls:

- **Swap** in the task toolbar exchanges the main view and active side-panel
  tab. Its tooltip names both views, for example **Swap Chat and Dashboard**.
  The previous main view becomes the active side-panel tab; other tabs stay
  available.
- **Layout** in the task toolbar moves the side panel left, right, or below the
  main area. Drag the divider to resize it. Narrow panes use a bottom panel
  until there is room for a side-by-side layout again.
- **Focus** in the task toolbar gives the main view the full task area.
  **Restore split** brings back the side panel with its previous placement and
  size.

Swapping, moving, and focusing preserve the live views, including chat drafts
and widget interactions. Closing the whole side panel hides its tabs and leaves
the main view in place. Closing the Dashboard tab removes that view from the
layout; it does not delete the board. Reopen it from the panel's **+** menu.
An empty dashboard stays open so you can add its first widget without changing
your chosen layout. The task toolbar sits above the main pane, aligned with the
side-panel tabs when the panes are side by side. In a stacked layout, each
header stays above its own pane. Side-panel tabs appear only when there are
views to switch between.

## Build a dashboard by asking

For a pinned data summary, ask for a **native report** with text, metrics, tables,
charts, or links. Reports render directly on the dashboard without an iframe or
inline preview. The agent updates the report's data when you ask; use an HTML
widget when you need custom interactivity. See [Native dashboard reports](/tools/show-widget#native-dashboard-reports).

Watch Patrick Erichsen build an OpenClaw 2.0 release dashboard from one prompt:

<iframe
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", aspectRatio: "16 / 9", border: 0, borderRadius: "8px" }}
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gHyBueWideg"
  title="Build an OpenClaw Dashboard with One Prompt"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Ask your agent for what you want to see:

> Create a widget named revenue-graph: an interactive bar chart of monthly
> revenue. Add "Bars" and "Trend" buttons that switch views. Pin it to my
> dashboard.

For this interactive HTML widget, the agent renders an inline chat preview first.
From there:

- **You pin it**: hover an inline widget and choose **Pin to dashboard**.
- **Or the agent pins it** directly when you ask, and updates it later by
  name — widgets have stable names, so "update revenue-graph with June's
  numbers" replaces the content in place while the board stays put.

The first dashboard created for an unarranged thread opens in the side panel once.
Updates after that do not reopen the panel or take focus from your current work.

Widgets are self-contained little apps (HTML/JS/SVG in a hard sandbox). Buttons
and view toggles inside a widget work immediately — switching a chart view
never needs the agent.

## The board

- **Fluid grid.** Drag widgets by their handle; everything reflows and
  compacts automatically. Resize by handle or pick a size preset (small,
  medium, large, extra large) from the widget menu. Nobody places pixels —
  not you, not the agent. On narrow boards, widgets stack at full width in
  their saved order; widening the board restores their saved column widths.
- **Automatic height.** HTML widgets adjust their height to fit their content.
  Resizing by handle or choosing a size preset fixes the height. Choose
  **Auto height** from the widget menu to fit the content again.
- **Tabs.** A board can have several pages — say, an overview tab and a
  focused tab with one big widget. Each tab remembers its widget layout.
- **Dashboard view.** The board can occupy the main area or a resizable side
  panel. With Dashboard active in the side panel, choose **Swap** in the task
  toolbar, then **Focus** for a dashboard-only view. **Restore split** brings
  the side panel back.
- **Agent parity.** The agent's `dashboard` tool creates or updates trusted
  plugin widgets, moves, resizes, and removes widgets, manages tabs, switches
  the visible tab, and requests a split or expanded dashboard with
  `set_presentation` and `presentation: "split"` or `"expanded"`. The `show_widget` tool
  creates or refreshes native reports, custom HTML, and registered-source widgets.
  An update uses `pin: true`, the same `name`, and new `widget_code` for HTML or
  registered source, or a new `report` object for a native report.
  Board snapshots identify each widget's `contentOwner` and, when applicable,
  `registeredContentKind`; remove a widget before replacing its content owner
  or registered source kind.
  Ask "show the finance tab and expand the dashboard" and watch it happen.

  Switching the visible tab or dashboard presentation requires a connected
  Control UI. If none is connected, the command returns `UNAVAILABLE`; open the
  Control UI and retry.
  `focus_tab` shows the dashboard in its current position. Call
  `set_presentation` after focusing the tab: `presentation: "expanded"` makes
  the dashboard main and focuses it; `"split"` reveals it using the current
  arrangement, bringing chat alongside when Dashboard is main.

## What widgets are allowed to do

A widget that only renders needs no approval — it appears instantly, exactly
like inline chat widgets, and its network access is fully disabled.

Widgets that want **reach** must declare it. An explicit [session permission mode](/gateway/permission-modes)
decides what happens: **Full access** grants immediately; **Workspace** uses an
AI reviewer and rejects anything it does not allow; **Guarded** shows an
**Allow** / **Reject** card; **Read only** rejects the request. Without an
explicit session mode, the equivalent configured exec approval policy applies.

- **Network** (`net`): fetch declared HTTPS origins directly from the sandbox —
  a weather card that refreshes itself from an API, for example.
- **Gateway data** (`data`): read-only feeds like sessions, usage, or cron
  status, resolved by the gateway — the widget never holds your token.
- **Automation** (`actions`): trigger a specific cron job, so a button can run
  a real task (which may use a smaller model) without waking your main
  conversation.
- **Prompt** (`prompt`): send messages into your thread without the per-click
  confirmation that unapproved widgets require.

Enabled plugins can add their own named read-only feeds and actions to these capability lists; disabling the plugin removes those integrations.

Grants are bound to the exact widget bytes approved by your session policy.
Changed HTML or registered-source bytes require a new decision even when the
permissions stay the same or shrink. A grant is preserved only when the
approved bytes still match and the requested permissions do not widen.
The authoring result distinguishes pending, rejected, and granted access;
saving a widget does not imply its capabilities were approved.
Widget interactions the agent should know about (filters you clicked, views
you switched) reach it quietly as session notices — it stays informed without
being interrupted.

## MCP apps on the board

If your gateway has MCP servers configured, interactive MCP apps that appear
in chat can be pinned like any widget. Pinned apps come back to life on the
board with fresh sessions. By default they render without server tools or
same-server resource access. Granting the widget its declared server tools
enables both bridges while that revision-bound grant remains active.

## A2UI widgets

When the Canvas plugin is enabled, agents can render A2UI JSONL as a dashboard
widget. A2UI widgets use the same stable name, tab, size, pinning, sandbox, and
update-in-place behavior as HTML widgets. The renderer is loaded from the
Gateway's `/__openclaw__/a2ui/` asset route, so the renderer bundle is not
copied into each widget. The Canvas plugin and its hosted routes must be
enabled; both are enabled by default.

A2UI actions use the normal widget bridge. By default, clicks become quiet
session notices that the agent sees on its next turn. If the widget declares
and receives the `prompt` grant, its actions can instead send a visible prompt
into the thread. Disabling the Canvas plugin removes the A2UI kind and leaves
stored widgets visibly unavailable until the plugin is enabled again.

## Retired Workspaces

The experimental Workspaces plugin, its Control UI tab, `openclaw workspaces`
CLI, and `workspace_*` tools have been removed. Session dashboards use a
different storage model: each board belongs to a session and lives in the
owning agent's database. Legacy Workspaces documents and databases are not
automatically converted.

Preserve any legacy documents, data, and widget assets before running
`openclaw doctor --fix`: its Workspaces repair deletes identified legacy state
under `<stateDir>/workspaces`, without importing that content into a dashboard.

## Good to know

- Resetting a thread that has a board asks for confirmation and keeps the
  board.
- Deleting a thread deletes its board.
- Boards live on your gateway (in the owning agent's database) and appear on
  every device you connect from.
- Dashboard-enabled threads appear in `/dashboards`. Closing the Dashboard tab
  or side panel does not delete the dashboard or remove it from the gallery.
- The security model, storage details, and design rationale live in
  [Dashboard Architecture](/web/dashboard-architecture), including the
  documented sandbox tradeoffs.

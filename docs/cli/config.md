Non-interactive helpers for `openclaw.json`: get/set/patch/unset a value by path, print the schema, validate, or print the active file path. Run `openclaw config` with no subcommand to open the same guided wizard as `openclaw configure`.

<Note>
When `OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`, OpenClaw treats `openclaw.json` as immutable. Read-only commands (`config get`, `config file`, `config schema`, `config validate`) still work; config writers refuse. Edit the Nix source for the install instead; for the first-party nix-openclaw distribution, use the [nix-openclaw Quick Start](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw#quick-start) and set values under `programs.openclaw.config` or `instances.<name>.config`.
</Note>

## Root options

<ParamField path="--section <section>" type="string">
  Repeatable guided-setup section filter when you run `openclaw config` without a subcommand.
</ParamField>

Guided sections: `workspace`, `model`, `web`, `gateway`, `daemon`, `channels`, `plugins`, `skills`, `health`.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw config file
openclaw config file --json
openclaw config --section model
openclaw config --section gateway --section daemon
openclaw config schema
openclaw config schema --json
openclaw config get browser.executablePath
openclaw config set browser.executablePath "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
openclaw config set browser.profiles.work '{"cdpPort":18801,"executablePath":"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"}' --strict-json --merge
openclaw config set agents.defaults.heartbeat.every "2h"
openclaw config set logging.audit.executionIdentity true
openclaw config set 'agents.entries.main.tools.exec.node' "node-id-or-name"
openclaw config set agents.defaults.models '{"openai/gpt-5.4":{}}' --strict-json --merge
openclaw config set channels.discord.token --ref-provider default --ref-source env --ref-id DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
openclaw config set secrets.providers.vaultfile --provider-source file --provider-path /etc/openclaw/secrets.json --provider-mode json
openclaw config patch --file ./openclaw.patch.json5 --dry-run
openclaw config unset plugins.entries.brave.config.webSearch.apiKey
openclaw config set channels.discord.token --ref-provider default --ref-source env --ref-id DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --dry-run
openclaw config validate
openclaw config validate --json
```

### Paths

Dot or bracket notation. Quote bracket paths in shell examples so zsh does not glob-expand `[0]`:

```bash
openclaw config get agents.defaults.workspace
openclaw config get agents.entries.main
openclaw config get agents.entries
openclaw config set 'agents.entries.work.tools.exec.node' "node-id-or-name"
```

Prefer `agents.entries.<id>` paths for agent edits. The legacy `agents.list[0]`
syntax and whole-list inputs still work with `set`, `patch`, and `unset`; writes
persist the canonical keyed roster. Indexed edits use the current roster order.
Within a batch, a submitted list keeps its order across subsequent keyed edits,
including when agent IDs are numeric strings. Existing roster-deletion and
`$include` ownership protections still apply.

When a legacy roster expands a single-agent installation in the root config file,
writes retire its `default` marker and preserve the existing agent's responsibilities
with explicit owners. An explicitly authored `ownership: "explicit"` cannot be
combined with a legacy `default: true` marker.

For root-file writes, changing `session.store` clears a copied
`agents.defaults.sessionStore.agentId` because that owner belongs to the previous
store. To assign the destination store's owner, set that owner path explicitly in
the same batch.

### `config get`

Reads a value from the redacted config snapshot (secrets never print). `--json` prints the same redacted value as JSON; otherwise strings/numbers/booleans print bare and objects/arrays print as formatted JSON.

A schema-valid but unset path explains that the runtime default applies; an unknown path suggests
`openclaw config schema`. With `--json`, both use the standard [CLI JSON failure envelope](/cli#json-failures)
on stdout and exit with status 1. Without `--json`, diagnostics remain on stderr.

```bash
openclaw config get browser.executablePath
openclaw config get agents.defaults.model --json
```

### `config file`

Prints the active config file path, resolved from `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` or the default location. The path names a regular file, not a symlink; see [Write safety](#write-safety).

With `--json`, stdout contains an object with the resolved path under `path`.

### `config schema`

Prints the generated JSON schema for `openclaw.json` to stdout.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it includes">
    - The current root config schema, plus a root `$schema` string field for editor tooling.
    - Field `title` / `description` docs metadata used by the Control UI.
    - Nested object, wildcard (`*`), and array-item (`[]`) nodes inherit the same `title` / `description` metadata when matching field docs exist.
    - `anyOf` / `oneOf` / `allOf` branches inherit the same docs metadata too.
    - Best-effort live plugin + channel schema metadata when runtime manifests can be loaded.
    - A clean fallback schema even when the current config is invalid.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Related runtime RPC">
    `config.schema.lookup` returns one normalized config path with a shallow schema node (`title`, `description`, `type`, `enum`, `const`, common bounds), matched UI hint metadata, and immediate child summaries. Use it for path-scoped drill-down in Control UI or custom clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

```bash
openclaw config schema
openclaw config schema --json
openclaw config schema > openclaw.schema.json
```

The schema is JSON in both modes. `--json` is accepted as the explicit
machine-output spelling and keeps stdout reserved for the schema document.

### `config validate`

Validates the current config against the active schema without starting the gateway. It also checks provider/source compatibility for every registry-declared SecretRef, including disabled plugin or channel configuration. This strict command can report an inactive mismatch that does not block normal Gateway startup, where SecretRef resolution remains limited to effectively active surfaces.

After schema validation, it checks every configured manual exec provider's command path using the same non-executing trust checks as startup: file presence, symlinks, trusted directories, permissions, ownership, and Windows ACL availability. `config set`, `config patch`, and `config unset` apply these checks only to providers changed or referenced by the operation, including during dry runs. Replacing the `secrets` or `secrets.providers` collection checks every remaining provider. An unrelated inactive provider does not block targeted repairs or removal of that provider.

Path validation does not execute providers or verify their output. Passing it does not guarantee successful secret resolution; exec dry runs require `--allow-exec` to test that separately.

```bash
openclaw config validate
openclaw config validate --json
```

<Note>
The exec-provider checks inspect the filesystem of the host where the CLI
runs. Run `config validate` on the gateway host itself (or on a host with
matching command paths, ownership, and ACLs). Paths and permissions can change
after validation; startup checks them again before execution.
</Note>

<Note>
If validation is already failing, start with `openclaw configure` or `openclaw doctor --fix`. `openclaw chat` does not bypass the invalid-config guard.
</Note>

Provider and runtime `params` bags are intentionally typed as
`Record<string, unknown>` because their owners define the supported keys and
values. `openclaw config validate` can validate the container and overall
config shape, but it cannot type-check provider-specific parameter names or
values. Passing validation does not prove that a param is supported; consult
the provider docs and verify behavior on the selected runtime and provider.

## Values

Values parse as JSON5 when possible; otherwise they are treated as raw strings. Use `--strict-json` to require standard JSON with no string fallback (JSON5-only syntax such as comments, trailing commas, or unquoted keys is then rejected). `--json` is a legacy alias for `--strict-json` on `config set`.

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.heartbeat.every "0m"
openclaw config set gateway.port 19001 --strict-json
openclaw config set channels.whatsapp.groups '{"*":{"requireMention":true}}' --strict-json
```

For structured values that are awkward to quote in your shell, put a config-shaped JSON5 object in a file and use [`config patch --file <path> --dry-run`](/cli/config#config-patch). The file contains config keys and their values, not a bare array.

`config get <path> --json` prints the redacted value as JSON instead of terminal-formatted text.

When a write changes `agents.defaults.model` or a per-agent `agents.entries.*.model`, OpenClaw resolves each changed primary or fallback through the configured catalogs and the selected provider's model resolver before writing. Provider-supported exact `provider/model` pins are accepted even when absent from the curated picker; validation does not replace the selected model. Unknown model references are rejected without changing the active config. Run `openclaw models list` to browse the picker, or check the provider's documentation for an exact model ID. Successful validation does not prove that your account can call the model.

<Note>
Object assignment replaces the target path by default. Protected paths that commonly hold user-added entries refuse replacements that would remove existing entries unless you pass `--replace`: `agents.defaults.models`, `agents.entries`, `models.providers`, `models.providers.<id>`, `models.providers.<id>.models`, `plugins.entries`, and `auth.profiles`.
</Note>

Use `--merge` when adding entries to those maps:

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.models '{"openai/gpt-5.4":{}}' --strict-json --merge
openclaw config set models.providers.ollama.models '[{"id":"llama3.2","name":"Llama 3.2"}]' --strict-json --merge
```

Use `--replace` only when the provided value should intentionally become the complete target value.

### Conditional writes

Use a conditional expectation when automation must update one authored path only if it has not
changed since the caller last observed it:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.port 19001 --strict-json --expect-current-json 18789
openclaw config set gateway.port 19001 --strict-json --expect-current-absent
```

`--expect-current-json <json>` uses strict JSON and compares the value by JSON type and structure.
`null` is an authored value, so it does not satisfy `--expect-current-absent`. The comparison uses
the effective authored config after includes and environment substitution, before runtime defaults
are applied.

The two expectation flags are mutually exclusive. They apply only to a single `config set`
operation, require a direct non-redirected config path, and cannot be combined with batch mode or
`--dry-run`. If input or roster resolution would write a different path than the caller requested,
such as a sibling `*Ref` path, the command exits with status 1 instead of retargeting the
expectation. A mismatch exits with status 1, writes nothing, and does not print either the expected
or current value. OpenClaw's config snapshot guard still rejects a later race between the
expectation check and the final file replacement.

## `config set` modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Value mode">
    ```bash
    openclaw config set <path> <value>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SecretRef builder mode">
    ```bash
    openclaw config set channels.discord.token \
      --ref-provider default \
      --ref-source env \
      --ref-id DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Provider builder mode">
    Targets `secrets.providers.<alias>` paths only:

    ```bash
    openclaw config set secrets.providers.vault \
      --provider-source exec \
      --provider-command /usr/local/bin/openclaw-vault \
      --provider-arg read \
      --provider-arg openai/api-key \
      --provider-timeout-ms 5000
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Batch mode">
    ```bash
    openclaw config set --batch-json '[
      {
        "path": "secrets.providers.default",
        "provider": { "source": "env" }
      },
      {
        "path": "channels.discord.token",
        "ref": { "source": "env", "provider": "default", "id": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" }
      }
    ]'
    ```

    ```bash
    openclaw config set --batch-file ./config-set.batch.json --dry-run
    ```

    Batch files are limited to 8 MiB.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
SecretRef assignments are rejected on unsupported runtime-mutable surfaces (for example `hooks.token`, Discord thread-binding webhook tokens, and WhatsApp creds JSON). See [SecretRef Credential Surface](/reference/secretref-credential-surface).
</Warning>

Batch parsing always uses the batch payload (`--batch-json`/`--batch-file`) as the source of truth; `--strict-json` / `--json` do not change batch parsing behavior.

Batch assignments apply in order, then validation checks the final config. A SecretRef replaced by a later assignment is not resolved or counted in dry-run output, even with `--allow-exec`. Providers that remain in a changed provider collection still receive command-path trust checks.

JSON path/value mode also works for SecretRefs and providers directly:

```bash
openclaw config set channels.discord.token \
  '{"source":"env","provider":"default","id":"DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"}' \
  --strict-json

openclaw config set secrets.providers.vaultfile \
  '{"source":"file","path":"/etc/openclaw/secrets.json","mode":"json"}' \
  --strict-json
```

### Provider builder flags

Provider builder targets must use `secrets.providers.<alias>` as the path.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common flags">
    - `--provider-source <env|file|exec|store>`
    - `--provider-timeout-ms <ms>` (`file`, `exec`)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Env provider (--provider-source env)">
    - `--provider-allowlist <ENV_VAR>` (repeatable)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File provider (--provider-source file)">
    - `--provider-path <path>` (required)
    - `--provider-mode <singleValue|json>`
    - `--provider-max-bytes <bytes>`

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exec provider (--provider-source exec)">
    - `--provider-command <path>` (required)
    - `--provider-arg <arg>` (repeatable)
    - `--provider-no-output-timeout-ms <ms>`
    - `--provider-max-output-bytes <bytes>`
    - `--provider-json-only`
    - `--provider-env <KEY=VALUE>` (repeatable)
    - `--provider-pass-env <ENV_VAR>` (repeatable)
    - `--provider-trusted-dir <path>` (repeatable)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Hardened exec provider example:

```bash
openclaw config set secrets.providers.vault \
  --provider-source exec \
  --provider-command /usr/local/bin/openclaw-vault \
  --provider-arg read \
  --provider-arg openai/api-key \
  --provider-json-only \
  --provider-pass-env VAULT_TOKEN \
  --provider-trusted-dir /usr/local/bin \
  --provider-timeout-ms 5000
```

## `config patch`

Paste or pipe a config-shaped JSON5 patch instead of running many path-based `config set` commands. Objects merge recursively; arrays and scalar values replace the target; `null` deletes the target path.

```bash
openclaw config patch --file ./openclaw.patch.json5 --dry-run
openclaw config patch --file ./openclaw.patch.json5
```

Patch files are limited to 8 MiB. Piped `--stdin` patches are limited to 1 MiB.

Pipe a patch over stdin for remote setup scripts:

```bash
ssh user@gateway-host 'openclaw config patch --stdin --dry-run' < ./openclaw.patch.json5
ssh user@gateway-host 'openclaw config patch --stdin' < ./openclaw.patch.json5
```

Example patch:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    slack: {
      enabled: true,
      mode: "socket",
      botToken: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" },
      appToken: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "SLACK_APP_TOKEN" },
      groupPolicy: "open",
      requireMention: false,
    },
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" },
      dmPolicy: "disabled",
      dm: { enabled: false },
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "openai/gpt-5.6-sol" },
      models: {
        "openai/gpt-5.6-sol": {
          agentRuntime: { id: "openclaw" },
          params: { fastMode: true },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The runtime pin makes this an embedded OpenClaw recipe. A valid `fastMode`
value is a portable typed runtime control and does not choose OpenClaw by
itself.

Use `--replace-path <path>` when one object or array must become exactly the provided value instead of being recursively patched:

```bash
openclaw config patch --file ./discord.patch.json5 --replace-path 'channels.discord.guilds["123"].channels'
```

`--dry-run` runs schema and SecretRef resolvability checks without writing. Exec-backed SecretRefs are skipped by default during dry-run; add `--allow-exec` when you intentionally want dry-run to execute provider commands.

## Dry run

`--dry-run` simulates a change without writing `openclaw.json`. Available on `config set`, `config patch`, and `config unset`. Which checks run depends on the input mode. Value mode (`config set <path> <value>` without `--strict-json`) skips the full schema pass and the ordinary SecretRef resolvability scan. Policy, provider, and model-reference checks can still run. When no checks apply, value mode reports `Dry run successful` even for a value the real write rejects. Use `--strict-json` (or `config patch --file --dry-run`) when you need schema validation.

```bash
openclaw config set channels.discord.token \
  --ref-provider default \
  --ref-source env \
  --ref-id DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN \
  --dry-run \
  --json

openclaw config set channels.discord.token \
  --ref-provider vault \
  --ref-source exec \
  --ref-id discord/token \
  --dry-run \
  --allow-exec
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dry-run behavior">
    - Value mode (a plain `<value>` without `--strict-json`): skips the full schema pass and ordinary SecretRef resolvability scan. Policy, provider, and model-reference checks can still run. When no checks apply, the CLI prints `Dry run note: value mode does not run schema/resolvability checks` and can succeed even when the real write would fail schema validation.
    - Builder mode: runs SecretRef resolvability checks for changed refs/providers.
    - JSON mode (`--strict-json`, `--json`, or batch mode): runs schema validation plus SecretRef resolvability checks.
    - Policy validation runs against the full post-change config, so parent-object writes (for example setting `hooks` as an object) cannot bypass unsupported-surface validation.
    - Exec command-path trust checks run without executing providers. Exec SecretRef resolvability checks are skipped by default to avoid command side effects; pass `--allow-exec` to opt in (this may execute provider commands). `--allow-exec` is dry-run only and errors without `--dry-run`.

    - `refsChecked`: number of refs actually resolved during dry-run
    - `skippedExecRefs`: number of exec refs skipped because `--allow-exec` was not set
    - `errors`: structured failures when `ok=false`; each carries a `kind` of `missing-path`, `schema`, `resolvability`, `model`, or `conflict` (`conflict` means the config file changed while the command was writing, so nothing was changed — re-run to pick up the new file)

## Applying changes

After every successful `config set` / `config patch` / `config unset`, the CLI prints one of three hints so you know whether the gateway needs a restart:

| Hint                                                | Meaning                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Restart the gateway to apply.`                     | The changed path needs a full restart. |
| `Change will apply without restarting the gateway.` | Hot reload picks it up automatically.  |
| `No gateway restart needed.`                        | Nothing runtime-relevant changed.      |

Effective changes to `plugins.entries` (or any subpath) require a restart, since the CLI cannot prove every plugin's reload metadata is loaded. Successful `config set` or `config unset` operations that produce no effective config diff print `No change` and leave the JSON5 file byte-for-byte untouched. A `config unset` target that is absent from the authored config exits with status 1 and also leaves the file untouched. Setting an absent key to a value equal to its runtime default is still an authored change and persists the explicit value.

## Write safety

`openclaw config set` and other OpenClaw-owned config writers validate the full post-change config before committing it to disk. If the new payload fails schema validation or looks like a destructive clobber, the active config is left alone and the rejected payload is saved beside it as `openclaw.json.rejected.*`.

OpenClaw-owned writes that change config reserialize JSON5 as standard JSON. When the source contains comments, the writer warns immediately before removing them; use a direct editor when preserving comments matters.

<Warning>
The active config path must be a regular file. Symlinked `openclaw.json` layouts are unsupported for writes; use `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to point directly at the real file instead.
</Warning>

Prefer CLI writes for small edits:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.reload.mode '"hybrid"' --strict-json --dry-run
openclaw config set gateway.reload.mode '"hybrid"' --strict-json
openclaw config validate
```

If a write is rejected, inspect the saved payload and fix the full config shape:

```bash
CONFIG="$(openclaw config file)"
ls -lt "$CONFIG".rejected.* 2>/dev/null | head
openclaw config validate
```

Direct editor writes are still allowed, but the running Gateway treats them as untrusted until they validate. At startup, eligible single-file configs can receive deterministic legacy-key migrations if the complete result validates, with the previous config kept in the `.bak` ring. Other invalid direct edits fail startup; hot reload skips invalid edits without rewriting `openclaw.json`. Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to repair prefixed/clobbered config or restore the last-known-good copy. See [Gateway troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting#gateway-rejected-invalid-config).

Whole-file recovery is reserved for doctor repair. Plugin schema changes or `minHostVersion` skew stay loud instead of rolling back unrelated user settings such as models, providers, auth profiles, channels, gateway exposure, tools, memory, browser, or cron config.

## Repair loop

After `openclaw config validate` passes, use the local TUI to have an embedded agent compare the active config against the docs while you validate each change from the same terminal:

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Inside the TUI, a leading `!` runs a literal local shell command (after a one-time per-session confirmation prompt):

```text
!openclaw config file
!openclaw docs gateway auth token secretref
!openclaw config validate
!openclaw doctor
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare with docs">
    Ask the agent to compare your current config with the relevant docs page and suggest the smallest fix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply targeted edits">
    Apply targeted edits with `openclaw config set` or `openclaw configure`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-validate">
    Rerun `openclaw config validate` after each change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Doctor for runtime issues">
    If validation passes but the runtime is still unhealthy, run `openclaw doctor` or `openclaw doctor --fix` for migration and repair help.
  </Step>
</Steps>

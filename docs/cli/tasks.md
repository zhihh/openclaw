Inspect durable background tasks and Task Flow state. With no subcommand,
`openclaw tasks` is equivalent to `openclaw tasks list`.

See [Background Tasks](/automation/tasks) for the lifecycle and delivery
model, and its `tasks audit` section for full finding descriptions.

## Usage

```bash
openclaw tasks
openclaw tasks list
openclaw tasks list --runtime acp
openclaw tasks list --status running
openclaw tasks list --status blocked
openclaw tasks show <lookup>
openclaw tasks notify <lookup> state_changes
openclaw tasks cancel <lookup>
openclaw tasks retry <lookup> [lookup...]
openclaw tasks dismiss <lookup> [lookup...]
openclaw tasks audit
openclaw tasks maintenance
openclaw tasks maintenance --apply
openclaw tasks flow list
openclaw tasks flow show <lookup>
openclaw tasks flow cancel <lookup>
```

| `--runtime <name>` | Filter by kind: `subagent`, `acp`, `cron`, or `cli`.                                                          |
| `--status <name>`  | Filter by status: `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `lost`, or `blocked`. |

## Subcommands

### `list`

```bash
openclaw tasks list [--runtime <name>] [--status <name>] [--json]
```

Lists tracked background tasks newest first.

Use `--status blocked` to find completed tasks whose result delivery is blocked.
These tasks retain their stored `succeeded` status and also remain included in
`--status succeeded` results; JSON task records keep the same stored status and
`terminalOutcome` fields.

### `show`

```bash
openclaw tasks show <lookup> [--json]
```

Shows one task by task ID, run ID, or session key.

### `notify`

```bash
openclaw tasks notify <lookup> <done_only|state_changes|silent>
```

Changes the notification policy for a running task.

### `cancel`

```bash
openclaw tasks cancel <lookup>
```

Cancels a running background task.

### `retry`

```bash
openclaw tasks retry <lookup> [lookup...]
```

Retries 1-10 blocked subagent completion deliveries. The child execution stays
successful; retry creates a fenced delivery generation from the retained
canonical result. An ambiguous earlier acknowledgement can still cause a
duplicate visible result.

Retry and dismissal select the task's exact retained run, never another result
from the same child session. Unrelated parent turns leave suspended completions
blocked until you retry them. Upgrading from an older release repairs missing task
bindings before loading runs, including runs that have not finished yet. Only
unambiguous bindings are repaired; conflicting records remain unchanged and
cannot be recovered by guessing from a shared session.

### `dismiss`

```bash
openclaw tasks dismiss <lookup> [lookup...]
```

Records intentional non-delivery for 1-10 blocked subagent completions. The task
continues to show a blocked terminal outcome and retains its result until the
7-day completion-retention window expires.

### `audit`

```bash
openclaw tasks audit [--severity <warn|error>] [--code <name>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

Surfaces stale, lost, delivery-failed, or otherwise inconsistent task and
Task Flow records. Lost tasks retained until `cleanupAfter` are warnings;
expired or unstamped lost tasks are errors.

`--code` accepts task codes (`stale_queued`, `stale_running`, `lost`,
`delivery_failed`, `missing_cleanup`, `inconsistent_timestamps`) and additional
Task Flow codes (`restore_failed`, `stale_waiting`, `stale_blocked`,
`cancel_stuck`, `missing_linked_tasks`, `blocked_task_missing`). See
[Background Tasks](/automation/tasks) for severity and trigger detail per
code.

### `maintenance`

```bash
openclaw tasks maintenance [--apply] [--json]
```

Previews or applies task and Task Flow reconciliation, cleanup stamping,
pruning, and stale cron run session registry cleanup.

For cron tasks, reconciliation uses persisted run logs/job state before
marking an old active task `lost`, so completed cron runs do not become
false audit errors just because the in-memory Gateway runtime state is gone.
Offline CLI audit and maintenance are not authoritative for the Gateway's
process-local cron, CLI, or ACP liveness. They retain active tasks of those
kinds when the local runtime cannot prove completion. Gateway maintenance
marks CLI tasks with a run id/source id `lost` when their live run context is
gone, even if an old child-session row remains.

When applied, maintenance also prunes `cron:<jobId>:run:<uuid>` session
registry rows older than 7 days while preserving currently running cron
jobs and leaving non-cron session rows untouched.

### `flow`

```bash
openclaw tasks flow list [--status <name>] [--json]
openclaw tasks flow show <lookup> [--json]
openclaw tasks flow cancel <lookup>
```

Inspects or cancels durable Task Flow state under the task ledger. There is no
top-level `openclaw flows` command. Both `flow show` and `flow cancel` accept a
flow ID or its stable owner key as `<lookup>`.

`flow list --status` accepts `queued`, `running`, `waiting`, `blocked`,
`succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `lost`. See [Task Flow](/automation/taskflow)
for ownership and lifecycle details.

---

Progress drafts turn one channel message into a live status line while an
agent works, instead of a stack of temporary "still working" replies. Set
`channels.<channel>.streaming.mode: "progress"` and OpenClaw creates the
message once real work starts, edits it as the agent reads, plans, calls
tools, or waits for approval, then delivers the final answer.

```text
Checking the streaming behavior and running the focused tests.
✅ Read the channel docs
▸ Run the focused tests
▢ Summarize the result
```

The default draft shows a status headline, authored plan steps, and approval
or failure lines. Set `streaming.progress.toolProgress: true` to add a rolling
tool log, with rows such as `🛠️ Bash: run tests`.

<Note>
  Discord defaults preview streaming to `off`; set `streaming.mode: "progress"`
  to opt in. Telegram defaults to `progress` without additional config. Set
  `mode: "partial"` on either to stream answer text instead. See
  [Streaming and chunking](/concepts/streaming#channel-mapping) for the full
  per-channel default table.
</Note>

## Quick start

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Defaults from here: a start delay of 1.5 seconds, a quiet status draft while
useful work happens, and suppression of the older standalone progress messages
for that turn. Raw tool-line drafts use
an automatic one-word label; a status headline omits that redundant title
unless you configure one explicitly.

This page covers the progress-draft experience and its config knobs. For the
full streaming-mode matrix, per-channel runtime notes, and legacy key
migration, see [Streaming and chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## What users see

| Part            | Purpose                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status headline | On Discord and Telegram, the model preamble; Discord adds a utility filler.   |
| Label           | Optional starter/status line such as `Working`.                               |
| Progress lines  | Plan milestones, enabled commentary/reasoning, and approval or failure lines. |
| Tool log        | Optional tool rows using the same icons and detail formatter as `/verbose`.   |

The status headline sits above the progress lines. With
`progress.toolProgress: true`, tool rows remain visible underneath it.

For raw tool progress, the label appears once the agent starts meaningful work
and stays busy for the initial delay.
It sits at the top of the rolling progress-line list, so it scrolls away once
enough concrete work lines appear. The implicit label is hidden while a status
headline is present unless you configure one explicitly. Plain text-only
replies never show a progress draft; a line appears only for real work updates,
for example `🛠️ Bash: run tests`, `🔎 Web Search: for "discord edit message"`,
or `✍️ Write: to /tmp/file`.

Final delivery depends on the channel and transport. OpenClaw either finalizes
the draft or sends a separate answer and cleans up or stops updating the draft
(see [Finalization](#finalization)).

## Choose a mode

`channels.<channel>.streaming.mode` controls the visible in-progress behavior:

| Mode       | Best for                         | What appears in chat                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `off`      | Quiet channels                   | Only the final answer.                            |
| `partial`  | Watching answer text appear      | One draft edited with the latest answer text.     |
| `block`    | Larger answer-preview chunks     | One preview updated or appended in bigger chunks. |
| `progress` | Tool-heavy or long-running turns | One status draft, then the final answer.          |

Pick `progress` when users care more about "what is happening" than watching
answer text stream token by token; `partial` when the answer text itself is
the progress signal; `block` for larger preview chunks. On Discord and
Telegram, `streaming.mode: "block"` is still preview streaming, not normal
block-reply delivery — use `streaming.block.enabled` for that.

## Configure labels

Progress labels live under `channels.<channel>.streaming.progress`. The default
raw tool-line label is `"auto"`, which uses the plain built-in `Working`
label. A status headline hides that implicit label; set
`label: "auto"` explicitly if you want a label above it too:

```text
Working
```

Use a fixed label:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          label: "Investigating",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Use your own label pool (still picked at random/by seed when `label: "auto"`):

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          label: "auto",
          labels: ["Checking", "Reading", "Testing", "Finishing"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Hide the label and show only progress lines:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          label: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Control progress lines

Progress lines come from real run events: tool starts, item updates, task
plans, approvals, command output, patch summaries, and similar agent activity.
`progress.toolProgress` decides whether ordinary tool calls become rolling
rows underneath the status headline. It defaults to `false` on every channel,
which keeps the draft quiet: the headline, enabled commentary and reasoning,
plan milestones, and any approval request or failed command still appear. Set
it to `true` for the full rolling tool log.

Native subagent spawn and activity events follow the same policy. They start
the quiet work indicator; with the tool log enabled, lifecycle updates reuse a
row for each worker. Messages to workers get separate entries because sending a
message does not prove that a worker started running. Delegation prompts are not
included in these progress rows.

Tools can also emit typed progress while a single call is still running. That
is how a slow fetch or search updates the visible draft before the tool
returns its final result. The progress update is a partial tool result with
empty model content and explicit public channel metadata:

```json
{
  "content": [],
  "progress": {
    "text": "Fetching page content...",
    "visibility": "channel",
    "privacy": "public",
    "id": "web_fetch:fetching"
  }
}
```

OpenClaw renders only `progress.text` in the channel progress UI. The normal
tool result still arrives later as `content`/`details` and is the only part
returned to the model.

When adding progress to a tool, emit a short, generic message and delay it
until the operation has been pending long enough to be useful. `web_fetch`
does exactly this with a 5-second delay:

```typescript
const clearProgressTimer = scheduleToolProgress(
  onUpdate,
  { text: "Fetching page content...", id: "web_fetch:fetching" },
  5_000,
  { signal },
);

try {
  return await runToolWork();
} finally {
  clearProgressTimer();
}
```

Fast calls show no progress line; long calls show one while still pending;
canceled calls clear the timer before stale progress can appear. Progress text
is a public UI side channel, so it must never include secrets, raw arguments,
fetched content, command output, or page text.

### Detail mode

OpenClaw uses the same formatter for progress drafts and `/verbose`:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      toolProgressDetail: "explain", // explain | raw
    },
  },
}
```

`"explain"` is the default and keeps drafts stable with concise labels.
`"raw"` appends underlying tool detail when available. Command text also
requires the explicit `streaming.progress.commandText: "raw"` opt-in below.
With that opt-in, a `node --check /tmp/app.js` call renders differently by mode:

| Mode      | Progress line                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `explain` | `🛠️ check js syntax for /tmp/app.js`                            |
| `raw`     | `🛠️ check js syntax for /tmp/app.js · node --check /tmp/app.js` |

### Command/exec text

`streaming.progress.commandText` (default `"status"`) controls how much command
detail shows next to exec/bash progress lines, independent of the detail mode
above. Set it to `"raw"` to opt into command text; keep `"status"` to show only
the tool-progress status:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          toolProgress: true,
          commandText: "raw",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Commentary lane

`streaming.progress.commentary` (default `false`) interleaves the model's
pre-tool commentary/preamble narration (💬, for example "I'll check... then
...") with tool lines in the draft. See
[Streaming and chunking](/concepts/streaming#commentary-progress-lane) for the
shared config shape across channels.

With the commentary lane enabled, preambles render only as those interleaved
💬 lines; the status headline below stays out of the way so the lane keeps its
documented shape.

### Status headline

On Discord and Telegram in progress mode, the model's typed pre-tool preamble
becomes the draft's status headline whenever it is available. Other
progress-mode channels keep their existing status behavior. The headline is on
by default and does not bypass the normal activity gate for short turns;
enabling `streaming.progress.commentary` hands preambles to the interleaved
commentary lane instead.

On Discord, when a utility model resolves for the agent — an explicit
[`utilityModel`](/gateway/config-agents#agents-defaults-model), or the primary
provider's declared small-model default (OpenAI → `gpt-5.6-luna`,
Anthropic → `claude-haiku-4-5`) — it supplies a short plain-language filler
when the model emits no preamble or has been quiet for about 20 seconds
(Telegram's headline is preamble-only today):

```text
Updating the default model in your config, then restarting the gateway to pick
it up. One agent listing call failed and is being retried.
```

Utility narration is on by default (`streaming.progress.narration`, default
`true`) and never falls back to the primary model: it runs only with an explicit
`utilityModel` or a provider-declared default for the agent's primary
provider. Set `utilityModel: ""` to disable utility routing entirely. When
`progress.toolProgress` is enabled, tool lines keep accumulating underneath. Draft
edits still wait for the normal activity gate and an actual
text change, which avoids flashes on fast turns and reduces edit churn in busy
channels. Set `narration: false` to disable only the utility-model filler; model
preamble headlines remain enabled:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          narration: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Narration input is bounded and redacted: the utility model receives the
inbound request text plus the same compact, redacted tool summaries the draft
would render — never raw command output or tool results. With
`commandText: "status"`, narration input also omits exec/bash command text,
matching what the draft shows.

Narration belongs to the current turn. Ending or replacing that turn cancels its
pending utility-model request and prevents late results from updating the draft.
Tool activity that accumulates during a narration request is reconsidered when
that request finishes, so an eligible status update needs no additional event.

### Line limits

Limit how many lines stay visible (default 8):

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          maxLines: 4,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Progress lines are compacted automatically to reduce chat-bubble reflow while
the draft is edited, and OpenClaw truncates long lines so repeated draft edits
do not wrap differently on every update. The default per-line budget is 120
characters; prose cuts at a word boundary, while long details such as paths or
raw commands are shortened with a middle ellipsis so the suffix stays visible.

Tune the per-line budget:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          maxLineChars: 160,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Show the tool log

Add the rolling tool log to the single progress draft:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "progress",
        progress: {
          toolProgress: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

With the default `toolProgress: false`, OpenClaw still suppresses the older
standalone tool-progress messages for that turn; the draft shows the headline,
authored text, plan milestones, and attention lines only.

## Channel behavior

| Channel         | Progress transport                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discord         | Send one message, then edit it.        | `progress` is explicit opt-in; the status draft is deleted after the final answer lands.                                                                  |
| Matrix          | Send one event, then edit it.          | Account-level streaming config controls account-level drafts.                                                                                             |
| Microsoft Teams | Native Teams stream in personal chats. | `streaming.mode: "block"` maps to Teams block delivery instead.                                                                                           |
| Slack           | Native stream or editable draft post.  | Card style is the default; `progress.style: "compact"` uses a temporary text draft, deleted after the final answer is delivered.                          |
| Telegram        | Send one message, then edit it.        | If a message lands between the progress draft and the answer, the draft reposts below it (post-new-then-delete-old) instead of scroll-jumping the client. |
| Mattermost      | Editable draft post.                   | `block` mode rotates between completed text and tool-activity posts; other modes fold tool activity into the same draft-style post.                       |

Channels without safe edit support fall back to typing indicators or
final-only delivery. See [Streaming and chunking](/concepts/streaming) for the
full runtime-behavior breakdown per channel.

## Finalization

When the final answer is ready, OpenClaw tries to keep the chat clean:

- In `progress` mode on Discord, the final answer is sent as a fresh message
  and the status draft is deleted once that answer is delivered. Busy channels
  keep no orphaned tool log above the reply; error finals keep the draft as the
  visible record of the failed turn.
- If the draft can safely become the final answer (`partial`/`block` modes),
  OpenClaw edits it in place.
- Slack's compact progress style posts the final answer as a new message and
  deletes its temporary drafts after confirmed delivery. Failed delivery keeps
  the draft visible.
- If the channel uses native progress streaming, OpenClaw finalizes that
  stream when the native transport accepts the final text.
- Otherwise (media, an approval prompt, an explicit reply target, too many
  chunks, or a failed edit/send) OpenClaw sends the final answer through the
  normal channel delivery path instead of overwriting the draft.

The fallback is intentional: sending a fresh final answer beats losing text,
mis-threading a reply, or overwriting a draft with a payload the channel
cannot represent safely.

## Troubleshooting

**I only see the final answer.**

Check that `channels.<channel>.streaming.mode` is `progress` for the account
or channel that handled the message. Some group or quote-reply paths disable
draft previews for a turn when the channel cannot safely edit the right
message.

**I see the label but no tool lines.**

Check `streaming.progress.toolProgress`. It defaults to `false`, which keeps
the single draft but hides the rolling tool rows; set it to `true` for the
full tool log.

**I see a fresh final message instead of an edited draft.**

That is the safety fallback described in [Finalization](#finalization). It can
happen for media replies, long answers, explicit reply targets, old Telegram
drafts, missing Slack thread targets, deleted preview messages, or failed
native stream finalization.

**I still see standalone progress messages.**

Progress mode suppresses default standalone tool-progress messages whenever a
draft is active. If standalone messages still appear, confirm the turn is
actually using `progress` mode and not `streaming.mode: "off"` or a channel
path that cannot create a draft for that message.

**Teams behaves differently from Discord or Telegram.**

Microsoft Teams uses a native stream in personal chats instead of the generic
send-and-edit preview transport, and maps `streaming.mode: "block"` to Teams
block delivery because it has no draft-preview block mode like Discord and
Telegram.

title: "The main session"
---

OpenClaw is a personal agent first. Out of the box, every direct message you
send it — from Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, Slack DMs, the web app, anywhere —
lands in **one rolling conversation**: the main session. Ask something on your
phone, follow up from your laptop, and the agent has the same context in both
places. There is one brain, and this is where it thinks.

Under the hood the main session is an ordinary session with the canonical key
`agent:<agentId>:main` (for example `agent:main:main`). The suffix is fixed;
custom `session.mainKey` values are ignored. What makes it special
is that the default DM scope collapses all direct messages into it, and that
the rest of the system treats it as the agent's root: heartbeats wake it,
background work reports back to it, and activity elsewhere flows up to it.

## Home

In the web app, the main session is the **Home** page — the first entry in the
sidebar. The identity row at the top is your agent (click it for the agent
menu); Home is where you talk to it. Sessions that fork off the main
conversation appear under **Threads**, group chats under **Groups**, and
coding/CLI sessions under **Coding**.

### Talk to Home while working

Select **Talk to your Home agent** in the sidebar footer (or press
`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H`) to open Home beside your current page. The assistant
sidebar can dock on the right or bottom.
It follows the agent selected in the sidebar's agent switcher, so there is one
place to change agents. **Ask OpenClaw** remains a separate system-care
conversation in the same sidebar.

The dock uses your real Home conversation, including its history, tools,
approvals, and message queue. **Open Home full page** opens that conversation
in the main area and temporarily hides its dock to avoid duplicate composers.

Expand **Working on** to inspect the small reference snapshot accompanying your
next message: the current page and, when available, the work session, workspace,
and visible file path. Select text in the work area and use **Attach selected
text** to include a bounded excerpt. Use **Remove work context** to send without
the snapshot. It becomes part of the sent message and remains unchanged through
queueing and retries; slash commands do not include it. References do not grant
the Home agent additional access to another agent's sessions or files.

## What flows into the main session

The main session is not just a chat log; it is the place where your agent's
world converges:

- **Group activity.** Under `session.groupScope: "per-group"` (the default),
  group and room sessions stay isolated while the main session automatically watches them.
  Activity queues up as compact notices — coalesced per conversation, never
  one wake-up per message — and the agent sees them the next time it runs: on
  your next message or on a scheduled heartbeat. Under the default `all`
  visibility, the main session can use session tools across the Gateway,
  with cross-agent access governed by `tools.agentToAgent` and on by default;
  its system prompt names watched groups so it knows where recent activity happened.
- **Background work.** Sub-agents and spawned sessions announce their results
  back to the session that started them, so work the agent kicked off from
  Home reports back to Home.
- **Heartbeats.** Scheduled heartbeats target the main session, which is what
  turns queued notices into awareness even when you have not written anything.

## Memory across resets and conversations

The rolling conversation is bounded by the model's context window, so
continuity comes from layers around it:

- `MEMORY.md`, the agent's curated long-term memory, is loaded into every
  fresh session. Daily notes (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) are searchable on demand
  and recent ones are re-primed after a `/new` or `/reset`. Before compaction,
  the agent flushes durable facts into the daily notes so long conversations
  do not silently lose them.
- **Memory recall across conversations** lets the agent recall content from
  its other private sessions. On personal setups — global
  `session.dmScope` resolving to `main` with no per-binding DM overrides — it
  is enabled by default; any configured DM isolation turns it off unless you
  opt in explicitly. See [Memory configuration](/reference/memory-config).

## A rolling session with durable history

The main session rolls forward through resets and compaction rather than
making the model carry its entire history at once:

- By default there is no automatic reset; compaction keeps the active context
  bounded while preserving the rolling session. Daily and idle resets are
  opt-in (see [Session management](/concepts/session)). On `/new` and `/reset`,
  the tail of the ending conversation is saved to daily memory notes, and the
  next session re-primes recent notes. Reset assigns a new live session id but
  keeps the previous SQLite transcript searchable under the same main-session
  key.
- When the conversation approaches the context window, compaction summarizes
  and continues in place — the transcript history stays in the session store.
- Session lists show the current live conversation, not every historical
  session id behind it.
- When the per-agent store's physical database, WAL, and session artifacts
  exceed the disk budget (default 10 GB), OpenClaw extracts the oldest
  unreferenced history to a verified compressed archive before removing its
  database rows. Live, routed, and in-flight sessions are never budget victims.

## When you want isolation instead

The shared main session is the right default for an agent that only you talk
to. If several people can message your agent, isolate DMs:

```json5
{
  session: {
    dmScope: "per-channel-peer",
  },
}
```

With an isolating scope, each sender gets their own session and
cross-conversation memory recall defaults off. Group watching remains controlled
independently by `session.groupScope`: `per-group` keeps ambient main-session
visibility, while `main` puts the room in the main conversation directly.
`openclaw security audit` recommends DM isolation when it detects multiple
senders. The full scope matrix, identity linking, and per-route overrides are
covered in [Session management](/concepts/session) and [Channel routing](/channels/channel-routing).

Groups and rooms use separate sessions by default. To make selected trusted
team rooms part of the rolling main conversation, set
`bindings[].session.groupScope: "main"` on their route bindings. This changes
the session key and shared context; mention gating and reply routing still use
the originating room. See [Session management](/concepts/session#group-and-room-routing).

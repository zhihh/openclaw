title: "Peekaboo bridge"
---

OpenClaw can host **PeekabooBridge** as a local, permission-aware UI automation broker (`PeekabooBridgeHostCoordinator`, backed by the `openclaw/Peekaboo` Swift package). This lets the `peekaboo` CLI drive UI automation while reusing the macOS app's TCC permissions.

## What this is (and is not)

- **Host**: OpenClaw.app can act as a PeekabooBridge host.
- **Client**: the `peekaboo` CLI (there is no separate `openclaw ui ...` surface).
- **UI**: visual overlays stay in Peekaboo.app; OpenClaw is a thin broker host.

## Relationship to other desktop-control paths

OpenClaw has four desktop-control paths that intentionally stay separate:

- **PeekabooBridge host**: OpenClaw.app hosts the local PeekabooBridge socket. The `peekaboo` CLI is the client and uses OpenClaw.app's macOS permissions for screenshots, clicks, menus, dialogs, Dock actions, and window management.
- **Agent-driven computer use (`computer.act`)**: the gateway agent's built-in `computer` tool captures screenshots via `screen.snapshot` and drives the pointer and keyboard through the dangerous `computer.act` node command. A macOS node fulfills `computer.act` in-process using the embedded Peekaboo automation services this bridge exposes plus narrow CoreGraphics primitives, without going through the PeekabooBridge socket or the `peekaboo` CLI. See [Computer use](/nodes/computer-use).
- **Codex Computer Use**: the bundled `codex` plugin checks and can install Codex's `computer-use` MCP plugin (`extensions/codex/src/app-server/computer-use.ts`), then lets Codex own native desktop-control tool calls during Codex-mode turns. OpenClaw does not proxy those actions through PeekabooBridge.
- **Direct `cua-driver` MCP**: OpenClaw can register TryCua's upstream `cua-driver mcp` server as a normal MCP server, giving agents the CUA driver's own schemas and pid/window/element-index workflow without routing through the Codex marketplace or the PeekabooBridge socket.

Use Peekaboo for the broad macOS automation surface via OpenClaw.app's permission-aware bridge host. Use agent-driven computer use when the gateway agent should see and control the desktop through a uniform `computer.act` node command that any vision model can drive. Use Codex Computer Use when a Codex-mode agent should rely on Codex's native plugin. Use direct `cua-driver mcp` to expose the CUA driver to any OpenClaw-managed runtime as a normal MCP server.

## Enable the bridge

In the macOS app, open **Dashboard → Settings → This Mac → Capabilities** and enable **Peekaboo Bridge**. The bridge requires **Computer Control** to be on, since both grant local UI automation; with Computer Control off the host does not run. To drive Peekaboo without Computer Control, run Peekaboo's own Mac app as the host instead.

When enabled (and Computer Control is on), OpenClaw starts a local UNIX socket server at `~/Library/Application Support/OpenClaw/<socket-name>`. If disabled, the host stops and `peekaboo` falls back to other available hosts. The coordinator also maintains legacy socket symlinks (`clawdbot`, `clawdis`, `moltbot` under Application Support) pointing at the current socket for older `peekaboo` installs.

For a one-off unattended run, `--attach-only --background-only` suppresses automatic windows and GUI-owned Keychain
loading. The persistent elevation host is a managed-deployment path for OpenClaw Foundation release operators. Its
`package` command requires the Foundation signing identity and notarization credentials; OpenClaw does not currently
publish a general-download elevation archive. Install only a certified, source-addressed archive supplied by an
authorized release operator:

```bash
cd /path/to/elevation-artifact-set
export PREFIX="OpenClaw-<full-openclaw-sha>-Peekaboo-<full-peekaboo-sha>-stable"
export INSTALLER_SHA256="<authenticated-installer-sha256>"
export RECEIPT_SHA256="<authenticated-receipt-sha256>"
[[ "$(shasum -a 256 "$PREFIX-installer.sh" | awk '{print $1}')" == "$INSTALLER_SHA256" ]] || exit 1
shasum -a 256 -c "$PREFIX.zip.sha256"
shasum -a 256 -c "$PREFIX-installer.sh.sha256"
./"$PREFIX-installer.sh" verify \
  --archive "$PREFIX.zip" \
  --receipt "$PREFIX.json" \
  --receipt-sha256 "$RECEIPT_SHA256"
./"$PREFIX-installer.sh" migration-plan \
  --migrate-launch-agent "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.node.plist"
./"$PREFIX-installer.sh" install \
  --archive "$PREFIX.zip" \
  --receipt "$PREFIX.json" \
  --receipt-sha256 "$RECEIPT_SHA256" \
  --migrate-launch-agent "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.node.plist"
./"$PREFIX-installer.sh" status --state-dir "<existing-state-dir>"
```

Transfer the complete artifact set: archive, receipt, portable installer, and both checksum files. The target Mac does
not need an OpenClaw source checkout. The authorized operator handoff must independently provide the installer and
receipt SHA-256 digests. Run `verify` with the authenticated receipt digest before planning a cutover; the receipt then
selects the approved archive and `verify` revalidates the Foundation-signed app, notarization, staple, Gatekeeper result,
architectures, entitlements, and both source revisions. The portable installer is not covered by the app's code
signature, so this explicit two-digest release-operator handoff remains part of the internal trust boundary.

Elevation artifacts require universal shared app code and both `arm64` and `x86_64` worker payloads under
`Contents/Resources/node-worker/`. The packager must provide both; `verify` checks both regardless of the target Mac's
architecture. Each worker must contain a Mach-O Node runtime, the OpenClaw package entrypoint, and build metadata matching
the app's version, source commit, build timestamp, and worker build ID. All native code in each worker, including addons,
static archives, and libraries without executable permission bits, must support its directory's architecture. Universal
Mach-O code is allowed; foreign-platform native code is rejected.
Signable Mach-O images must also expose native signature metadata for every slice. A generic resource signature,
even when strict whole-app verification succeeds, is not native-signature evidence. Compatible thin, fat32, and fat64
static archives remain resources protected by the app seal and architecture checks; they need no standalone Mach-O
signature. Mixed archive/native containers fail verification. Inspection never thins or rewrites the supplied payload.
Missing or unexpected architecture trees, escaping or cyclic worker symlinks, and thin shared executables or executable
libraries fail verification. Dependencies that violate this closure must be repaired in packaging, not excluded from
validation. The portable installer needs neither a checkout nor a separate inventory helper.

Both standard and elevation packaging construct fresh workers from the complete installed package without changing that input.
It preserves JavaScript, WASM, other resources, modes, and contained relative symlinks, and omits only native images
that cannot run on the selected Darwin architecture. Matching universal binaries remain intact. Windows-named source,
scripts, and README files remain; directory names do not select files for omission. Unclassifiable native images and
links that would escape, cycle, or become dangling stop packaging.
Both paths use the same worker verification and publication flow; build metadata remains unchanged by materialization.

The managed elevation workflow upgrades an already paired Mac. Its selected state and config must define an
app-readable direct remote Gateway route with string token or password auth, and the selected macOS node identity must
already be paired. `migration-plan` performs those checks without changing the app, process, LaunchAgent, state, or
Gateway. It recognizes the canonical CLI-managed `ai.openclaw.node` job and app-backed background LaunchAgents. If the
old app is running in background mode without a LaunchAgent, use `--adopt-running-app` instead of
`--migrate-launch-agent` and pass its state/config paths explicitly when they are not the defaults.

`--elevation-host` is implied by the installed job. It keeps the Bridge, control channel, Mac node, Gateway
connectivity, and termination handling active while disabling automatic windows, updater startup, Dock promotion,
pairing and exec-approval presenters, Quick Chat hotkeys, voice and cookie services, and GUI-owned Keychain reads.
Missing Screen Recording, Accessibility, or Event Synthesizing is reported by `status`; the host never opens System
Settings to grant it. Installation succeeds once the launchd-owned process is Bridge-ready even if those grants are
still incomplete, but it commits only after the exact paired node identity reconnects as `openclaw-macos/node` with the
new app version, `computer` capability, `screen.snapshot`, `computer.act`, and a computer-use descriptor. The installer
copies no Gateway credentials or interactive `PATH`; it carries only the verified state/config ownership paths and
uses the config's existing route and auth. `status` rechecks Bridge, Gateway node, and TCC readiness. The installer
uses the separate `ai.openclaw.mac.elevation-host` job and refuses to race or rewrite ordinary **Launch at login**
(`ai.openclaw.mac`).

Cutover is transactional: the installer snapshots the exact app and source plist, stops the prior owner, installs the
replacement, and automatically restores the original bytes and loaded state if launchd, Bridge, or Gateway node
attestation fails. The install receipt binds rollback plist digests, the prior app CDHash, and any previous managed
install receipt. Generation-unique backups allow successive upgrades; `recover` preserves the replaced app in a unique
evidence directory, restores the prior receipt, and refuses to overwrite a source LaunchAgent path recreated by another
owner.

The elevation archive is Foundation-signed, notarized, stapled, named by the full OpenClaw and Peekaboo source
commits, and contains exactly `OpenClaw.app`. Its receipt binds the archive and portable-installer names and digests,
OpenClaw and Peekaboo source revisions, signer, per-architecture CDHashes, architectures, entitlement digests, and Apple notarization
submission ID. No AppleScript or Apple Events entitlement is part of this workflow.

## Client discovery order

Peekaboo clients typically try hosts in this order:

1. Peekaboo.app (full UX)
2. Claude.app (if installed)
3. OpenClaw.app (thin broker)

Use `peekaboo bridge status --verbose` to see which host is active and which socket path is in use. Override with:

```bash
export PEEKABOO_BRIDGE_SOCKET=/path/to/bridge.sock
```

## Security and permissions

- The bridge validates **caller code signatures**. The production OpenClaw host accepts only the exact Peekaboo CLI
  bundle (`boo.peekaboo.peekaboo`) signed by Peekaboo's canonical current/legacy release signer set (`FWJYW4S8P8`
  and `Y5PE65HELJ`); sharing the app's UID or using another client signed by the app's development team is not
  sufficient.
- Prefer the signed bridge/app identity over a generic `node` runtime for Accessibility. Granting Accessibility to `node` lets any package launched by that Node executable inherit GUI automation access; see [macOS permissions](/platforms/mac/permissions#accessibility-grants-for-node-and-cli-runtimes).
- Requests time out after 10 seconds (`requestTimeoutSec: 10`).
- If required permissions are missing, the bridge returns a clear error message rather than launching System Settings.

## Snapshot behavior (automation)

Snapshots are stored in memory with a 10-minute validity window and a cap of 50 snapshots (`InMemorySnapshotManager`); artifacts are not deleted on cleanup. If you need longer retention, re-capture from the client.

## Troubleshooting

- If `peekaboo` reports "bridge client is not authorized", ensure the client is properly signed or run the host with `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1` in **debug** mode only.
- If no hosts are found, open one of the host apps (Peekaboo.app or OpenClaw.app) and confirm permissions are granted.

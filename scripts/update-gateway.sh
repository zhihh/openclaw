# Updates a self-hosted OpenClaw gateway that runs from this source checkout.
#
# Reference workflow for team-operated servers (see docs/install/updating.md).
# Simple installs should prefer `openclaw update` / `openclaw update --channel
# dev`; this script exists for checkouts that additionally need to:
#   - preserve a local branch by rebasing it onto origin/main,
#   - refuse all tracked local changes, including build outputs,
#   - build clean (incremental builds have shipped stale hashed chunks),
#   - restart a custom service unit.
#
# Environment:
#   OPENCLAW_UPDATE_RESTART_CMD  restart command (default: openclaw gateway restart)
#                                set to "" to skip the restart step
#   OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REMOTE       git remote to update from (default: origin)

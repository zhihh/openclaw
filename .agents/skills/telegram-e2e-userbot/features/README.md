# Telegram E2E verification map

This map is the maintained source for proving what an OpenClaw Telegram user
sees through the dedicated QA user account.

## Baseline preconditions

- Complete Prepare, Doctor, and proof-directory creation in [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md).

## Driving conventions

- Use `run-mock-sut-user-e2e.mjs` for every recipe. It owns a fresh SUT gateway.
- Prefer `--dm` for isolated turns. Use the group only for mention and reaction behavior.
- Give every feature its own proof subdirectory and explicit `--record` plus `--output` paths.
- After a failed drive, rerun doctor before another Telegram action.

## Proof gate

- Apply the evidence and cleanup gates from `SKILL.md` to every recipe.
- Record an unreachable path with the exact command and missing account, chat,
  entitlement, OS, or external-service prerequisite.

## Features

- [Basic turns](./basic-turns.md): real-user group, DM, and native-command entry points.
- [Delivery lifecycle](./delivery-lifecycle.md): messages, edits, typing, and receipt finalization.
- [Reaction lifecycle](./reaction-lifecycle.md): acknowledgement and status reactions on the user's message.
- Photo and album turns: pass `--photo PATH` to the canonical runner; repeat it for one Telegram media album and inspect `messagePhoto` events plus provider evidence.

## Other branches

- [Runtime reference](./runtime-reference.md): backends, manual tools, event fields, and failure triage.

## Reaching non-default config

The whole point of an audit lane is exercising config the default path never uses:

| Knob                        | Reaches                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `E2E_TELEGRAM_CONFIG_PATCH` | anything under `channels.telegram` (streaming, replyToMode, richMessages)                                                       |
| `E2E_ROOT_CONFIG_PATCH`     | the config root — `messages.*` for ack/status reactions and reply visibility; `null` removes a seeded key                       |
| `E2E_REQUIRE_MENTION=true`  | makes the test group mention-required; ack scope treats `group-mentions` as mention-_required_ groups, so reaction rows need it |
| `E2E_TELEGRAM_PROVIDER_API` | `openai-completions` for commentary and preamble scenarios                                                                      |
| `E2E_MOCK_SERVER_PATH`      | an alternate mock server for provider-shape controls                                                                            |
| `--source-gateway`          | the exact TypeScript checkout without a build step                                                                              |
| `--pre-send '<text>'`       | posts as the QA user before the driven turn, for history-scoped rows                                                            |

Scenario action `command` runs argv without an implicit shell in the leased
test environment. It receives the leased TDLib state, SUT bot token,
`TELEGRAM_E2E_TEST_API_ROOT`, Gateway config, and Gateway state. Set `cwd` to
`repo`, `workspace`, `state`, or `root`. The summary keeps only status, timing,
exit code, and timeout. The command writes any deliberately sanitized artifact
it needs. Invoke a shell explicitly when the test needs shell syntax.

Call any Test Bot API method at
`$TELEGRAM_E2E_TEST_API_ROOT/bot$TELEGRAM_E2E_SUT_BOT_TOKEN/<method>`.
The local proxy forwards the method, query, headers, and body to Telegram's
Test Server.

Command actions stay in the runner-owned process group by default. A command
that deliberately creates a new process session owns that session and stops it
before the scenario finishes.

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "command", "argv": ["pnpm", "openclaw", "status", "--json"], "cwd": "repo" }
  ]
}
```

Bot API response controls reproduce a send that Telegram accepted while the
fresh test Gateway callback stays unresolved. Arm one method, wait until it is
held, then release it after the behavior checkpoint:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "telegramApiHold", "method": "sendMessage", "skip": 1 },
    { "type": "telegramApiWaitHeld", "atMs": 1000, "method": "sendMessage" },
    { "type": "telegramApiRelease", "atMs": 5000 }
  ]
}
```

Follow-up drain controls hold one session callback at a known point, then
release it after the behavior checkpoint:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "followupDrainHold", "sessionKey": "agent:main:main" },
    { "type": "followupDrainWaitHeld", "atMs": 1000 },
    { "type": "followupDrainRelease", "atMs": 5000 }
  ]
}
```

Scenario action `cron` runs one isolated, announced agent job while the recorder is active. The runner waits for TDLib readiness before starting action offsets, sends DM delivery to the selected tester, sends group delivery to the recorder-resolved chat id, and removes the job after the run. Require the summary action row to contain `jobId`, `runId`, `runStatus`, `cronDeliveryTarget`, and `cleanup`.

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "cron",
      "message": "Write the exact recipient-facing schedule confirmation."
    }
  ]
}
```

# OpenClaw Release CI

Use this with `$release-openclaw-maintainer` and `$openclaw-testing` when a release candidate needs full validation, install/update proof, live provider checks, or CI recovery.

## Guardrails

- No version bump, tag, npm publish, GitHub release, or release promotion without explicit operator approval.
- After compaction, resume, or new steering, rewrite the effective goal and
  current phase from the latest explicit operator instruction. Do not merge old
  scope back into the active release.
- Hold the release scope once a release branch or Code SHA exists. Validate and
  ship that exact release; do not turn moving `main` into a second work queue.
- Record every active validation run as the immutable tuple **Validation SHA +
  Tooling SHA + rerun group**. Validation SHA maps to the Code SHA for product validation or
  the Release SHA for changelog-only validation; it is not a third release
  identity. A branch or temporary ref is context and transport.
- Freeze the candidate SHA/ref and Tooling SHA/ref once. Main lineage authorizes
  the initial Tooling SHA selection; it does not authorize replacing that
  tooling after `main` advances.
- Apply a release firebreak after the Code SHA is frozen. Admit only confirmed
  product defects, package/provenance defects in the bytes to publish, security
  defects, or failures that make publication impossible. Queue other findings
  for postpublish confidence or the next beta.
- Use trusted `main` workflow revisions as immutable dispatch sources. Do not
  adopt newer main code, repair unrelated main CI, wait for broad main health,
  or expand a release fix because the workflow source lives on `main`.
- Once publication binds the Tooling SHA to an exact protected lightweight
  `release-publish/<12sha>-<provenance-run>` tag, that live tag-to-SHA mapping
  remains authoritative when `main` advances. The suffix records tag-creation
  provenance; it is not the current parent run id.
- Touch `main` only for an operator-requested change or the smallest critical
  main-owned blocker that prevents this release and cannot be handled from the
  release branch. If the required main landing policy is blocked by unrelated
  main failures, report that blocker and keep independent release work moving
  instead of healing broader main.
- Validate provider secrets before dispatching expensive full release matrices.
- Linux (`ubuntu`) cross-OS lanes gate publication for beta, stable, and full.
  Windows/macOS cross-OS lanes run in parallel as advisory coverage. Record
  their actual pass/fail conclusions; failures do not block Release Decision,
  npm publication, or `pnpm release:candidate`. Keep normal CI, npm
  qualification, Docker, Package Acceptance, performance, and soak gates intact.
- macOS app signing/notarization/appcast and Windows Hub asset promotion run
  in parallel with or after npm publication and never delay npm or GitHub
  finalization. Their own qualification and artifact gates still apply; track
  selected platforms through verified assets and updater evidence separately.
- Do not set GitHub secrets from unvalidated 1Password candidates. If a candidate returns 401/403, leave the existing secret alone and report the exact missing provider.
- Use `$one-password` for secret reads/writes: one persistent tmux session, targeted items only, no secret output.
- Watch one parent run plus compact child summaries. Avoid broad `gh run view` polling loops; REST quota is easy to burn.
- Fetch logs only for failed or currently-blocking jobs. If quota is low, stop polling and wait for reset.
- Treat live-provider flakes separately from code failures: prove key validity, provider HTTP status, retry evidence, and exact failing lane before editing code.
- A model-list response proves authentication, not billing or inference
  entitlement. Mandatory live providers must pass a real completion probe
  before release dispatch. Fix the credential first; do not add an alternate
  auth path merely to bypass a failed release credential.
- Full Release Validation separates exact-child dispatch, Release Decision,
  and Diagnostic Drain. With `fail_fast=false`, it makes zero child
  cancellation calls; Diagnostic Drain follows every selected child to
  terminal unless the collector itself is cancelled or loses GitHub API
  access. With
  `fail_fast=true`, Release Decision may cancel only the exact still-active
  child that owns a blocking failure.
- Same-parent continuation requires the original root to have been dispatched
  with `fail_fast=false`. The controller verifies that exact logged input
  before any rerun mutation.
- A parent that produced its own sealed candidate artifacts cannot be continued:
  GitHub reruns make those prior-attempt artifacts unavailable. Keep the
  candidate and Tooling SHAs frozen, supersede that parent, and start a fresh
  all-group Full Release Validation.
- After dispatch, one immutable execution-plan artifact records the original
  parent attempt, exact child tuples and titles, selected coverage, gates, and
  reuse identity. The same bytes are saved under an exact run-ID cache key.
  Decision, Drain, manifest writing, evidence validation, and final verification
  consume the artifact for their current attempt. A collector retry restores
  the cached plan, validates it, re-uploads its artifact, and adopts the same
  children; missing plan state is an orchestration failure, not permission to
  reconstruct the plan or redispatch.
- Reused evidence is not trusted merely because plan sealing found it. Release
  Decision repeats the sealed target SHA, evidence SHA, policy, changed paths,
  selected run, root run, source manifest, trusted tooling identity, and
  exact-child checks before returning `passed`.
- Parent retries select the newest Decision and Drain artifacts independently;
  both must bind the same immutable plan even when their source attempts differ.
- Child retries are part of the same immutable plan only when the child run ID,
  workflow path, ref, Tooling SHA, dispatch title, event, target, candidate, and
  validation inputs remain exact. Newer child attempts replace matching jobs;
  jobs absent from a newer attempt carry forward. A duplicate job identity,
  missing attempt, regressed attempt, or changed tuple fails closed.
- Use `pnpm frv status|continue --failed|verify` for attempt-aware recovery.
  The controller is stateless: the immutable execution plan, exact GitHub run
  attempts, Diagnostic Drain, and final manifest are the only authorities. It
  never writes a tag, package, registry entry, release candidate, or
  publication.
- Post-merge controller proof must use the reviewed landed SHA on protected
  `main` through the non-release `FRV Proof Broker` and `FRV Proof Fixture`.
  Dispatch the broker with the merged pull request number and exact landed
  commit. The broker must require that pull request's merge commit to match the
  landed commit, prove the landed commit is identical to or an ancestor of its
  trusted workflow SHA, and repeat authority, merge, and ancestry checks
  immediately before rerunning the fixture.
  Require the exact fixed no-op fixture run to advance from its intentional
  attempt-one failure to an attempt-two pass. The broker must emit its receipt
  without creating a release candidate, release artifact, publication,
  repository ref, replacement parent, or other workflow mutation. This is the
  hosted GitHub failed-job rerun proof; focused controller tests own immutable
  plan eligibility, green-attempt preservation, same-parent collection, and
  strict-verifier invocation. Never use a real Full Release Validation run for
  this proof. See
  [Full Release Validation](/reference/full-release-validation#post-merge-continuation-proof).
- Use one release operator, one transition-only watcher, and at most one
  investigator for the current failed surface. Do not build audit-review-plan
  trees around a single workflow transition.
- For regular beta/stable releases, treat the product-complete pre-changelog
  commit as the Code SHA. Full product validation and performance evidence bind
  to that SHA. The later Release SHA may reuse those results only when it is a
  descendant whose complete changed path set is exactly `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Extended-stable validates one exact branch tip; it does not reuse the regular
  Code-SHA/Release-SHA evidence model.
- In a sparse worktree or Testbox source sync, first confirm `package.json`,
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and every source path the selected check reads. If any are
  absent, that checkout cannot validate a release dependency or Docker lane:
  stop and use the repo remote changed gate or a full task worktree. When the
  inputs are present and a release fix changes `package.json` or
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`, rebuild only the task-owned disposable box with
  `CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then run an explicit
  `require.resolve()` probe before Docker or focused tests. The CI flag permits
  pnpm to recreate a prewarmed modules directory without an interactive
  confirmation. Do not weaken the lockfile or label sparse-checkout failures
  as product/Docker failures.
- If the candidate is rebased or its base SHA changes after warmup, stop the
  task-owned box and warm a fresh one before testing. Testbox source sync is
  relative to the warmed source tree; continuing can mix an old base file with
  a new candidate diff and produce false lockfile or Docker failures.
- Reused Testboxes are provenance-gated after their first successful run.
  Source-only edits may reuse the lease; base, dependency, wrapper, or Testbox
  workflow drift requires a fresh lease. Do not set
  `OPENCLAW_TESTBOX_ALLOW_STALE=1` for release evidence.
- For a committed release candidate, warm the box with
  `blacksmith testbox warmup ... --ref <candidate-branch-or-sha>`. Do not rely
  on source sync to overlay committed branch changes onto the workflow's
  default ref.

## Run identity and retry budget

Record Validation SHA, Tooling SHA/ref, target context ref, parent run id,
attempt, and phase before watching or recovering Full Release Validation. Keep
Code SHA and Release SHA separately in the lifecycle ledger. Record the
immutable Release Publish parent receipt separately from tag provenance.

For the core and plugin npm mutations enforced by this foundation, re-read the
exact protected lightweight tag and revalidate the exact parent run tuple
immediately before each publish or dist-tag mutation. Reject a missing, moved,
annotated, or wrong-SHA tag; a repository, workflow, run id, attempt, tooling
identity, or parent-state mismatch; and any same-name branch. Never refresh
either identity from current `main`. Treat other privileged writers as blocked
until their dependent enforcement changes land.

- Conceptual phases map to current inputs as follows:
  - `beta-publish`: `release_profile=beta`, `run_release_soak=false`
  - `postpublish-confidence`: published package inputs with
    `run_release_soak=true` or explicit focused groups
  - `stable-publish`: `release_profile=stable`
- An `all` run without soak for an actual beta package on its matching canonical
  release branch or beta tag records `coveragePolicy=npm-beta-v1`. It keeps
  Linux/macOS/Windows Node, Control UI, plugin, package, install/update,
  Linux cross-OS, QA parity, runtime-pair/restart, and tool-coverage gates. Native app
  CI, performance, and published-package Telegram are deferred to confidence.
  Beta `all` without soak also defers Package Acceptance Telegram, including
  beta-profile checks of `main` or alpha. Record deferred checks as not run,
  never passed. Stable/full, soak, and focused groups retain their coverage;
  selected children still require terminal evidence. An absent coverage policy
  retains historical full behavior.
- Keep at most one active parent for the same Validation SHA + Tooling SHA + rerun
  group + release profile + effective soak coverage. Stable/full always include
  soak. Distinct coverage profiles can run independently; concurrency does not
  cancel an older exact child automatically.
- Parent cancellation or timeout leaves adopted identity-checked children
  running. The operator must cancel an exact child explicitly when it is no
  longer useful. Do not infer a child identity from branch, title prefix, or
  latest-run order.
- Recover one failed surface with one diagnosis, one fix when needed, and one
  narrow retry. Then reassess the release decision. Do not automatically
  dispatch `rerun_group=all`.
- For a supported parent, `pnpm frv continue --failed --run <parent-run-id>`
  adopts any active newer child attempt, reruns failed child jobs in parallel,
  leaves green children untouched, then reruns the parent once to restore the
  immutable plan and seal a trusted all-group manifest. It does not start a
  second child retry while an attempt is active. Each child or parent rerun
  mutation is sent exactly once; ambiguous transport failures trigger only
  bounded read reconciliation. The controller never repeats the mutation, and
  provenance drift fails closed.
- Inspect without mutation:

  ```bash
  pnpm frv status --run <parent-run-id>
  pnpm frv verify --run <successful-parent-run-id>
  ```

- Parents whose immutable plan predates attempt-aware evidence cannot be
  continued. Start a fresh all-group Full Release Validation; never reconstruct
  old state or dispatch a replacement parent.

- Controller retries are `ci`, `plugin-prerelease`, `install-smoke`,
  `cross-os`, `live-e2e`, `package`, `qa-parity`, `qa-live`, `npm-telegram`,
  or `performance`. Never use the removed `release-checks` handle. `qa` is
  only a direct-child manual aggregate, not a controller retry API.
- Filtered retries fail closed unless the filter belongs to the selected group.
  All-group runs also accept `cross_os_suite_filter`: for example,
  `-f cross_os_suite_filter=ubuntu,macos` excludes Windows. `npm-stable-v1` and
  `npm-beta-v1` still qualify when advisory OS lanes are omitted, provided all
  Linux suites remain selected and the other policy requirements hold.
  Never turn an empty derived filter into an unfiltered broad run.
- A new all-group parent is justified only when shared orchestration changed,
  earlier evidence is invalid for the selected tuple, or the operator explicitly
  requests it. Record the invalidating event.
- Narrow child or group evidence does not by itself become publish
  authorization. Keep it in the evidence ledger for the release owner to judge
  against the current publish gate.

## Preflight

Before full matrix dispatch, run both `pnpm ui:i18n:check` and
`pnpm native:i18n:check` against the frozen trusted target in approved isolation.
Bind both results to that exact SHA; either generated-locale drift blocks
dispatch. Keep target execution outside the trusted dispatch helper—do not
execute an arbitrary target checkout as helper code.

Before expensive full validation, also run `pnpm ui:build` on the same frozen
trusted target with its frozen dependencies in approved isolation, outside the
trusted dispatch helper. Record the target SHA with the successful production
build, precompressed-asset verification, and startup/largest-asset budget results;
any failure blocks fanout. Do not substitute a dev server or raise budgets to admit
the target.

Before full release validation:

```bash
node .agents/skills/release-openclaw-ci/scripts/verify-provider-secrets.mjs --required openai,anthropic,fireworks
gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.core'
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
```

1Password service-account values are the first source for release provider
preflight. Inject those exact targeted keys first, then run the verifier; use
ambient env only when it was already intentionally injected for this release.
The script prints only provider status and HTTP class, never tokens.
The Anthropic check performs a tiny message completion so exhausted or
non-billable credentials fail before the expensive release matrix.

## Dispatch

An early standalone product-performance run is optional beta confidence. If
useful, start it against the frozen Code SHA in parallel with release work:

```bash
# Optional early beta confidence; stable/full use the required parent child.
fail_on_regression=false
gh workflow run openclaw-performance.yml \
  --repo openclaw/openclaw \
  --ref main \
  -f target_ref=<code-sha> \
  -f profile=release \
  -f repeat=3 \
  -f deep_profile=false \
  -f live_openai_candidate=false \
  -f fail_on_regression="$fail_on_regression"
```

- Do not add a separate mandatory prepublish wait for this optional beta signal.
- Compare available Kova, gateway startup, and CLI startup metrics with earlier
  release evidence or clawgrit reports before publish/closeout.
- Call out any regression in the release proof. Treat a major regression as a
  release blocker until it is fixed, waived by the operator, or proven to be
  infrastructure noise.
- Full Release Validation requires blocking performance evidence for stable
  and full profiles. `npm-beta-v1` defers the child; explicit `performance`
  and soak-enabled beta runs retain advisory performance coverage. Every
  selected performance child must finish and prove artifact-only publication.

Prefer an immutable trusted-main workflow revision, target the exact Code SHA:

- Keep trusted-workflow checks compatible with frozen release targets. If
  `main` adds a target-owned guard script or package command after the release
  branch cut, make the trusted workflow skip only when that target surface is
  absent. Repair the smallest trusted-workflow compatibility issue only when it
  blocks the release, then rerun validation. Do not port an unrelated runtime
  refactor, heal other main failures, or mutate the release candidate just to
  satisfy a newer `main`-only check.

```bash
TOOLING_SHA="<exact-main-ancestor-sha>"
node scripts/full-release-validation-at-sha.mjs \
  --sha <code-sha> \
  --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
  --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"
```

For regular `release/*` validation, never raw-dispatch the workflow without
`target_context_ref` (the helper's `--target-ref` records it). Canonical
`release/*` and `extended-stable/*` workflow refs remain supported routes, but
their Telegram child must retain the exact parent workflow ref and SHA through
OIDC and attestation. Trusted-workflow release-branch CI passes `target_ref` +
`release_candidate_ref`; never `release_gate` there — it requires workflow head
== target. (The PR-head ci.yml fallback below is a different dispatch and does
use `release_gate=true`.)

The release branch may advance after the Code SHA is frozen. The helper accepts
that frozen SHA only while it remains an ancestor of the canonical release
branch and its package version is either the branch's final version or a
matching beta prerelease. Alpha remains on the Tideclaw path with a matching
alpha branch and exact alpha tag. Extended-stable branches and all tags require
an exact package-version match.
Always pass the previously recorded full Tooling SHA for release-branch runs.
Never replace it with a fresh `main` lookup. The Tooling SHA must declare the
current release-isolation contract; older workflow revisions fail closed.

For immutable workflow proof on a moving `main`, use
`pnpm ci:full-release --sha <code-sha> --target-ref
release/YYYY.M.PATCH --workflow-sha <tooling-sha>`. Its canonical `release-ci/*` ref keeps evidence reuse
enabled after proving the workflow commit is still on trusted `main` lineage.
Pass `-f reuse_evidence=false` only when the operator intentionally needs a
fresh full run.

After the Code SHA is green, commit only `CHANGELOG.md` and run the same helper
against the Release SHA. The parent must report
`policy=changelog-only-release-v1`, `evidenceSha=<code-sha>`, and
`changedPaths=["CHANGELOG.md"]`; it should reuse the product matrix instead of
dispatching child lanes. Npm preflight and package/install acceptance still run
against the exact Release SHA and its new tarball bytes.

Current all-group FRV also owns read-only npm source/build/qualification and
Docker preparation. Use its successful run as `preflight_run_id`; the candidate
helper defaults to that run. Do not dispatch a second npm preflight unless
recovering historical separate evidence. Regular final qualification records
SDK reports for both `beta` and `latest`; review the acknowledgement for the
actual publication channel. Prepared descriptors live in `publicationArtifacts` in
the exact final manifest. Product evidence reuse never substitutes Code-SHA
package or image bytes for the final Release SHA. A parent that produced these
artifacts needs a fresh all-group FRV instead of same-parent continuation.

The SHA-pinned helper infers `beta` for matching beta release candidates and
exact alpha tags, and `stable` for stable/correction versions, then passes the
Validation SHA + Tooling SHA run identity. Canonical beta `all` without soak
uses `npm-beta-v1`; `main`, alpha, and non-beta targets do not qualify for that
policy. Run deferred native, performance, Telegram, broad live QA, and E2E as
postpublish confidence with the exact published package and
`run_release_soak=true` or explicit groups. Stable and full profiles force the
release soak. Native artifact publication still requires its own build,
signing, notarization, and promotion gates. Use a narrow `rerun_group` after
focused fixes; never widen automatically.
Publish with `openclaw-release-publish.yml` using `release_profile=from-validation`
unless a maintainer intentionally wants to cross-check a specific profile; the
publish workflow reads the effective profile from the full-validation manifest.

### Extended-stable validation

For `.33+`, dispatch from and target the canonical branch. This direct route is
intentional: downstream extended-stable evidence requires the canonical branch
identity, while Telegram still authenticates the exact branch SHA:

```bash
RELEASE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
gh workflow run full-release-validation.yml \
  --ref extended-stable/YYYY.M.33 \
  -f ref=extended-stable/YYYY.M.33 \
  -f expected_sha="$RELEASE_SHA" \
  -f release_profile=stable
```

Accept only a complete `rerun_group=all` run whose branch, head/target SHAs,
manifest `workflowRef`, and package versions identify the same commit. Save its
successful `run_attempt` and require the final tag to resolve there. Reject
`release-ci/*`, current-main, narrow, and earlier-attempt evidence.

Product failures need an approved backport. Frozen-target tooling failures need
the smallest behavior-preserving repair. Provider, approval, runner, or log
races keep the candidate unchanged. Record repairs and superseded runs; any
branch change requires a new complete parent. Omit only an explicitly
unsupported frozen-target scenario, never a required behavior or package.

## Watch

Use the transition-only summary watcher instead of repeated raw polling:

```bash
node scripts/release-ci-summary.mjs <full-release-run-id> --watch
```

Do not start this watcher when the SHA-pinned helper is still the foreground
owner. The helper reads the exact Release Decision artifact itself. On
`blocked_diagnostics_running`, it exits nonzero immediately, keeps the temporary
refs, and leaves Diagnostic Drain collecting the remaining terminal evidence.
The watcher behaves the same way for separately dispatched parents: it reports
the Release Decision blocker once and exits while the drain continues.

For a one-shot snapshot:

```bash
node scripts/release-ci-summary.mjs <full-release-run-id>
```

`release-ci-summary` accepts Full Release Validation parent runs only.
Diverged release-branch logs: `--first-parent` plus a bounded count.
Stop watchers before ending the turn or switching strategy.

Interpret state precisely:

- `qualifying`: no decisive blocker yet; selected children are still active.
- `blocked_diagnostics_running`: publication is blocked; Diagnostic Drain is
  still collecting independent failures. Diagnose now, but do not retry until
  the drain is terminal.
- `passed`: all required policy and exact-child evidence passed.
- `blocked_complete`: publication is blocked and all selected diagnostics are
  terminal.
- `orchestration_error`: GitHub API or collector failure prevented a verdict.
  This is not a provenance mismatch. Recover the collector against the same
  exact children; never redispatch tests to repair collection.
- `cancelled_with_children`: the collector was cancelled while exact children
  remained active.

Read **advisory** entries separately from Release Decision. Windows/macOS
cross-OS lanes retain their actual conclusions in the manifest and summary;
`passed` does not mean those advisory lanes passed. Selected lanes still need
terminal evidence, and filtered-out lanes are not run, never passed.

The `full-release-diagnostics-<run-id>-<attempt>` artifact is the terminal
failure and timing manifest. Use it after an early blocker instead of
restarting `all` merely to discover what the still-running children found.
The stable `full-release-execution-plan-<run-id>` artifact is the identity
source within each collector attempt; retry attempts restore its immutable
run-ID-cached bytes first.

## Failure Triage

1. Confirm parent SHA and child run IDs.
2. List failed jobs only:
   ```bash
   gh run view <child-run-id> --repo openclaw/openclaw --json jobs \
     --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion=="failure" or .conclusion=="timed_out" or .conclusion=="cancelled") | [.databaseId,.name,.conclusion,.url] | @tsv'
   ```
3. Fetch one failed job log. If rate-limited, note reset time and avoid more REST calls.
4. For secret-looking failures, validate a real completion from the same secret source before editing code. A successful model-list request is insufficient.
   Claude CLI subscription credentials are a separate native auth path; prove
   them in a clean-home CLI probe, never as a substitute for a required
   Anthropic API-key lane.
5. For live-cache failures, inspect whether it is missing/invalid key, empty text, provider refusal, timeout, or baseline miss. Do not weaken release gates without clear provider evidence.
6. Classify before editing:
   - confirmed product/code failure: fix the release branch, freeze a new Code
     SHA, and invalidate product evidence
   - harness/tooling/provenance failure: keep the Code SHA, fix the smallest
     owning surface, and retry only the failed surface with the required Tooling
     SHA
   - infrastructure/credential failure: keep both SHAs, repair the external
     prerequisite, and retry only the failed surface
   - wrapper/monitor failure: keep the child and candidate identities; record
     the wrapper result separately from the child result
   - changelog/release-note failure: change only `CHANGELOG.md`, keep Code SHA
     evidence, and repeat Release SHA proof
   - publish child/registry selector failure: keep Release SHA and resume the
     failed child; never rebuild an immutable version that already published
     Only the first class changes the Code SHA. After one diagnosis/fix/narrow
     retry, reassess instead of starting another all-group cycle.
7. If a required PR CI run is capacity-stalled with queued jobs and no active
   jobs, do not cancel unrelated work or accept a generic manual dispatch.
   First verify the PR head carries the current fallback schema:
   `gh api 'repos/openclaw/openclaw/contents/.github/workflows/ci.yml?ref=<pr-head-branch>'
--jq .content | base64 --decode | rg -q 'pull_request_number:'`. If absent,
   refresh the PR head from `main` and use the new head SHA; let normal CI run
   before considering another fallback.
   From the PR head branch, dispatch the explicit exact-SHA fallback:
   `gh workflow run ci.yml --repo openclaw/openclaw --ref <pr-head-branch> -f
target_ref=<full-pr-sha> -f pull_request_number=<pr-number> -f
include_android=true -f release_gate=true`.
   It runs on GitHub-hosted runners and is accepted only when its run title is
   `CI release gate <full-pr-sha>`. Record the stalled Blacksmith run and the
   fallback run in release evidence.
   If `Blacksmith Build Artifacts Testbox` is the only remaining required gate
   and remains queued without a runner, that completed exact fallback may cover
   it because CI's `build-artifacts` job already builds, packages, and smoke
   tests the artifacts. Do not use this coverage after the artifact workflow
   starts or completes non-successfully.

## Evidence

Record:

- release lifecycle ledger: Code SHA, Release SHA, and Tooling SHA for regular
  releases; canonical branch, exact SHA, and immutable tag for extended-stable
- evidence-reuse policy, coverage policy, and complete changed-path set
- active full parent run URL, attempt, workflow SHA, and any superseded parent
  with the exact replacement reason
- selected child run IDs and conclusions: CI, Release Checks, Plugin Prerelease, NPM Telegram, Product Performance; record deferred confidence as not run
- Windows/macOS cross-OS advisory lane classifications and actual conclusions
- performance comparison result versus earlier releases when available
- targeted local proof commands
- provider-secret preflight result
- frozen-target compatibility repairs or omitted inapplicable scenarios, with
  their source PRs and invariant
- known gaps or unrelated failures
